      <description>pre code, pre, code { white-space: pre !important; overflow-x: scroll !important; word-break: keep-all !important; word-wrap: initial !important; }  Rely on the infra For a recent project I needed to find an efficient way to extract data from API’s and load the response into a database residing in the cloud. It’s a fairly common use case, as most online platforms expose data via callable API’s. My personal goal was to introduce as little tooling and code as possible.</description>

      <description>pre code, pre, code { white-space: pre !important; overflow-x: scroll !important; word-break: keep-all !important; word-wrap: initial !important; }  They grow up so fast It’s been at least a year since I last dabbled in TensorFlow, and the ecosystem seems to have grown a lot. The general trend is towards higher-level abstractions for building models, defining data pipelines or serving predictions. Then there is also the relentless community-driven development, spawning many useful extensions to the official library.</description>
