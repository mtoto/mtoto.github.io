      <description>pre code, pre, code { white-space: pre !important; overflow-x: scroll !important; word-break: keep-all !important; word-wrap: initial !important; } library(knitr) eng_go Go in the fast lane Fast data is the new big data. But how difficult is it really to set up a complete streaming analytics solution from the ground up? It turns out not that hard, not if you are using NATS Streaming. Developed in Go
 “…NATS Streaming is an extremely performant, lightweight reliable streaming platform built on NATS.</description>

      <description>pre code, pre, code { white-space: pre !important; overflow-x: scroll !important; word-break: keep-all !important; word-wrap: initial !important; }  Kubernetes who? The hype around kubernetes is real, but likely also justified. Kubernetes is an open-source tool that facilitates deployment of jobs and services onto computer clusters. It provides different patterns for different type of workloads, be it API servers, databases or running batch jobs. Not only makes kubernetes running workloads and services easy, it also keeps them running.</description>

      <description>pre code, pre, code { white-space: pre !important; overflow-x: scroll !important; word-break: keep-all !important; word-wrap: initial !important; }  We have updated our privacy policies… Whether internet companies are now compliant with GDPR is hard to say, but they sure left updating their privacy policies to the last minute. What happened in the last days of May was the greatest corporate email tsunami since Y2K. I hardly read the updated policies, or remember what the old ones looked like.</description>

      <description>pre code, pre, code { white-space: pre !important; overflow-x: scroll !important; word-break: keep-all !important; word-wrap: initial !important; }  Getting on the Docker (container) ship Containers are everywhere, including the realms of data science. You can think of them as small self-contained environments, encapsulating an application and its dependencies. If that sounds a lot like a virtual machine, you are not entirely wrong. But unlike VM’s, containers run on the host system’s kernel and the processes inside can only see and access their immediate surroundings.</description>

      <description>pre code, pre, code { white-space: pre !important; overflow-x: scroll !important; word-break: keep-all !important; word-wrap: initial !important; }  The rise of the API Rich API interfaces are one of the main ingredients of today’s smart devices. They are by definition built for interconnectivity and there is an active community of developers creating apps as microservices on top of them.

      <description>Starting an analytics blog Having learned lots from the open source community over the past years - from blogs and videos to attending meetups and awesome conferences - I have decided to start a blog myself, and share some of the things I find interesting. I expect most of the posts to be R specific, because that’s what I am most comfortable with. However I do enjoy fiddling with other technologies such as Python or Spark, so watch out!</description>
