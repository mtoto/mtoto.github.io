1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:02,034
Morty, hurry!

2
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:03,836
Return the Truth Tortoise!

3
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:06,238
Morty, whatever you do,
don't drop the Truth Tortoise!

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,539
Also really important,

5
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,141
whatever you do,
don't look into its eyes!

6
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,844
I... I did look at it, Rick!
I've been looking at it!

7
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,579
Now you're gonna know
everything, Morty!

8
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,481
Good job! Way to go!
You [BLEEP] everything up!

9
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,651
It's in my head!

10
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,320
Ah!

11
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:27,559
Oh, geez, I... I can't get that
Truth Tortoise out of my head.

12
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,561
Yeah, I told you not
to look into its eyes.

13
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,663
Hey, Morty, let's watch some
interdimensional cable.

14
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,232
Remember how we used to do that?

15
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,000
Rick, I can't...
I can't go on.

16
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,336
I-I can't go on like this with the
Truth Tortoise shit in my head.

17
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:38,604
I-I wish you could just...

18
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:40,739
Erase the memory from your mind?

19
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,741
How did you know
I was gonna say that?

20
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,443
Come on, Morty, come with me.

21
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:47,546
After you.

22
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,381
What the hell is this?!

23
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,983
This, Morty, is my archive

24
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:53,719
of all the experiences
you've begged me to remove

25
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,754
from your life,
lest you go insane.

26
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:59,324
I call them
Morty's Mind Blowers.

27
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,061
And we'll be doing this instead
of interdimensional cable.

28
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,961
How long have I been asking you
to remove memories?

29
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,297
Since the first time
your mind was blown.

30
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,665
Ahh, here it is.

31
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,266
Classic.

32
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,634
There's no dust on it because

33
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,069
this isn't the first time
we've done this.

34
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:48,240
- What?!
- I call this one "Moonspiracy"!

35
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,515
Huh, wow.
That's incredible.

36
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,619
What the heck?

37
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,621
Morty, do you realize how
ridiculous that sounds?

38
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,223
Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty.

39
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,724
Are you serious?

40
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,726
Half the crap we've seen,
and you think that sounds crazy?

41
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,595
I've been to 300 versions
of Earth's moon,

42
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,597
including this one,
and I've never seen signs

43
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,432
of a "regular dude,"
as you describe him,

44
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:14,700
hanging out up there.

45
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,935
It's probably just
a smudge on the lens.

46
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,038
Smudge on the lens?
Smudge on the lens?!

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,474
I know the difference between
a man threatening me

48
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,409
and a smudge on
the goddamn lens, Summer!

49
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,345
Morty, calm down!
Are you feeling okay?

50
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,280
I'm fine!

51
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,748
So sensitive.

52
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,652
Kids,
I'd like to introduce you all

53
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,655
to our new guidance counselor,
Mr. Lunas.

54
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,291
I look forward
to helping guide you all

55
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,460
towards a brighter future.

56
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:44,096
I believe every
student should...

57
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,331
shoot for the moon.

58
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,704
Got you now, you son of a bitch.

59
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,142
What's this?

60
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,811
Proof that Mr. Lunas
isn't who he says he is!

61
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,680
He's not a guidance counselor?

62
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,916
I... I assume he's qualified
to be one, who isn't?

63
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:07,186
But he also lives on the moon.

64
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,787
Okay.

65
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,055
Hmm.

66
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,456
Is that it?

67
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,192
Is he doing anything
to hurt anyone?

68
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,993
Oh, he's up to something.

69
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,129
I think I understand.

70
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,364
"Up to something,"
"lives on the moon."

71
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,266
Okay, I'll talk to him.

72
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,845
What did he say?

73
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,781
Denied the moon stuff,
but that's what pedophiles do,

74
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,416
they deny,
it's their bread and butter.

75
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,717
Pedophile?
You don't think so?

76
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,719
I thought the moon thing
might have been code.

77
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,321
No, he's literally
from the moon!

78
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,655
Well, you saw him react.

79
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,058
Moon or not,
that dude likes 'em young.

80
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,966
Gordon Lunas was a good Marine.

81
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,468
We don't know what drove
him to take his own life,

82
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,570
but we want to remember
the good things.

83
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,339
Like how, from a certain angle,

84
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,175
some people would say
he looked like a smudge.

85
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,015
Oh, my God, what have I done?

86
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,116
What have I done?

87
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,386
Jesus, I made that guy
kill himself!

88
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,821
Only in a literal sense.

89
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,023
Here's one I call
"Morty's Menagerie."

90
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,025
They don't all
have titles, though.

91
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:22,160
It's not a "Simpsons"
Halloween special,

92
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:25,097
more like a clip show made
of clips you never saw!

93
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,066
I can't believe we got
put into a menagerie.

94
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,635
So this guy collects
living beings?

95
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,370
Yeah, you know like
commemorative plates,

96
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,871
but less off-putting.

97
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,707
You'll get it when you're still
actively dating in your 40s.

98
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,342
Assess this with
cold indifference,

99
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,610
you beany-headed prick!

100
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,479
Hey, keep it down!

101
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,080
Just our luck, menagerie beneath

102
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,149
the "boulder people"
of Granitor Seven.

103
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,751
I can't take it anymore, Rick!

104
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,252
Relax, Morty!

105
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,321
I can't relax! R-R-Rick, we...
We gotta get outta here!

106
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,256
I don't care what it takes!
Anything!

107
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,724
- Anything?
- Anything!

108
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,626
All right, well, you're gonna
have to take off your shirt.

109
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,561
Not yet.
I'll tell you when.

110
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,302
Dear God.

111
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,803
What?

112
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,972
The signal
turned out to be...

113
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,508
There's no other way
to put it...

114
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,976
Instructions.
For?

115
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,979
A vehicle, sir,
an interstellar vehicle.

116
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,982
We'll need a pilot.
I wonder if there's a volunteer.

117
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,183
Mm.

118
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,053
Oh, the schematics specify
a second, smaller pilot.

119
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,155
I mean, they really
specify smaller.

120
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,691
They have to be exactly 5'3".

121
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:28,193
Chang, you may have majored
in Liberal Arts,

122
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,796
but I think you're about
to make history.

123
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,633
Primary systems, check.

124
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,368
Auxiliary systems, check.

125
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,903
See you soon.

126
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,709
Okay, now.

127
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,610
Greetings.

128
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,012
You're...
You look...

129
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,314
We've possessed forms
your mind can accept.

130
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,683
Here are some customary
clothing gifts.

131
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,418
Please, put them on.

132
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,620
- May we?
- Of course, yes.

133
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,089
We followed your instructions.

134
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:59,858
We have so much
to learn from you.

135
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,494
I know, right?

136
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,135
Hey, how come I was able to see
those other people's memories?

137
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,037
I... I wouldn't have been
around for that.

138
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,039
Yeah, sometimes I gotta do
a little editing, Morty.

139
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,307
It helps the mind blowers

140
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,342
play a little bit better
upon revisiting.

141
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,811
I call this one
"The Whole Enchilada."

142
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,748
Here, Morty, this'll make
your urine drinkable.

143
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,549
Now can we keep shopping?

144
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,251
I am Zikzak.

145
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,787
Ah, shit, Morty, get behind me.
It's a [BLEEP] alien overlord!

146
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,622
It's okay.
Here.

147
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:31,990
Oh, I misjudged.

148
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,493
"I am Floop Floopian.
Please kill me."

149
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,128
That's right, Morty.

150
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,830
The Floop Floopians achieve
an eternal orgasmic afterlife,

151
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,899
so long as they're killed
by a great warrior.

152
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,801
I'm flattered, by the way.
Thank you very much.

153
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,169
So you're gonna kill him?

154
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,138
Eh, let's get some lunch first.

155
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,244
So, you want to get shot
in the head, or...

156
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,812
Well, as long as
the wound is fatal,

157
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,280
I don't really mind
where you shoot me.

158
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,282
Cool.
I'm gonna go take a quick shit.

159
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,618
Well, I gotta say.
You know, I'm a little envious.

160
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,653
Your species has
an actual afterlife.

161
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,288
That's gotta be nice.

162
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,656
Wh-What do you mean?

163
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,092
Well, you know, here on Earth,
w-we don't know what's going on.

164
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,127
It must be nice for you guys to,
you know, have that...

165
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,296
Have that proof's in
the pudding, you know, evidence.

166
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,468
Evidence?
There's supposed to be evidence?

167
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,937
Um, yeah, uh...

168
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,974
otherwise,
how do you know if it's true?

169
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,546
Wait, you don't...

170
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,682
All right, so you want to do
this here or outside?

171
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,752
Run!

172
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,621
I don't wanna die!

173
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,395
Oh, God, it's all real!
Oh, it hurts!

174
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:44,963
Oh, I shouldn't have doubted it!

175
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,199
I shouldn't have let
you make me doubt it!

176
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:50,235
Aah!
I blame you, I blame you!

177
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,137
But he said there
wasn't any evidence!

178
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,572
That was a ton of evidence!

179
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:54,773
Well, silver lining.

180
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,208
Now I know their
religion's real.

181
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,143
They have a hell,
and it does not look good.

182
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,212
I noticed you never finished
your chimichanga,

183
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:02,714
so I got some room for it now,
if you know what I mean.

184
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,182
Holy [BLEEP]!

185
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,685
How many of these are just
horrible mistakes I've made?

186
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,386
I mean, maybe
I'd stop making so many

187
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,155
if I let myself learn from them!

188
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,057
Don't break your back
creating a lesson, Morty.

189
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,391
It's a freeform anthology.

190
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,260
I'm getting annoyed
you're not hearing that.

191
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,062
As you can see around me,
your mind's been blown

192
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:20,565
countless times,
and not always by yourself.

193
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,133
Ah, [BLEEP],
I don't even...

194
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,668
This better not
have been a good one.

195
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,936
What is this?

196
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,838
Great, "Booger AIDS,"
"AIDS Booger."

197
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,406
I gotta start using
real file names.

198
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,108
In the meantime,
enjoy a grab bag

199
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,346
of mind blowers I call
"Poop AIDS underscore copy."

200
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,581
I'm not
an unreasonable man, Beth Smith.

201
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,117
I know children are everything
to a mammal.

202
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,952
I will spare one of their lives.

203
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,722
You simply have to choose.

204
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,191
Summer!
Summer.

205
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,296
You're not gonna believe this.

206
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,931
I went to Phoebe
instead of Titan.

207
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,166
It's, like, hello, Saturn,
after ten moons,

208
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,869
time to stop naming and start
numbering, you know?

209
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,105
What's... Wh-What's with you
assholes?

210
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,440
Morty, please, don't do this.

211
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,877
Your Morty is gone!

212
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,846
I am Voltamatron,
Destroyer of Worlds!

213
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,415
Grandpa Rick, there must be some
scientific way to save him!

214
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,484
Not scientific,
but there may be a way.

215
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,953
Morty, I know you're in there.
It's me, your grandpa.

216
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,955
I know I can be mean,
but I love you, Morty.

217
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,423
We all do,
you gotta fight this thing.

218
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,325
I know you can.
You're stronger than all of us!

219
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,527
Morty, it's mom! We love you,
you have to fight it!

220
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,130
Come on, Morty!
Fight that stupid worm thing!

221
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,598
We love you!

222
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,933
We love you so much!

223
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,334
Yes, Morty, come on,
you're doing it!

224
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,937
You're doing it!
You're doing it!

225
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,273
Should we pull it out?

226
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,943
No, don't touch it.
Just keep loving Morty!

227
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,312
We still love you.

228
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,980
But I do have
a thing at 6:00.

229
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,615
Oh, God, do I have
to keep looking?

230
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,884
Geez, Morty, come on,
pinch it off already!

231
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,056
Don't! Oh, God, sorry, Morty,
I love you!

232
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,426
God, is there going
to be an intermission?

233
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,561
Excuse me, but I ordered
the large evil space worm.

234
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,496
I know, it's like,
is that a demon slug

235
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,265
in your stomach,
or are you just happy to...

236
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,334
Sorry!

237
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,970
Well, I guess it's nice to know
the whole family sucks!

238
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,504
So if the blues ones
are my fault,

239
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:09,274
and the purple ones are my
family's, what are the red ones?

240
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,876
Yeah, d-don't read
into it, Morty!

241
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,746
Ahh.

242
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,182
[BLEEP] We need to find shelter
before the sunset, Morty.

243
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,684
Venzenulon Nine has a night
temperature of 300 below!

244
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,220
We'll freeze, Morty!
W-We'll be dead in seconds!

245
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,022
I... I think I saw
a cave over there.

246
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,557
You've seen
too many movies, Morty.

247
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,226
A cave isn't gonna cut it.
We're gonna have to use Beebo.

248
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,428
Beebo led us to water!
He's our friend!

249
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,697
- He won't even feel it!
- Oh, no, no!

250
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,069
You wanna die, Morty?
Get in Beebo!

251
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,839
Oh, no, no!

252
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,008
Brace for the ice limit.

253
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,577
Here it comes!

254
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:52,250
Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine
or Venzenulon Seven?

255
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,220
Wait a minute, why would I ask
for that to be removed?

256
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,555
Are the red ones stuff
you wanted removed?

257
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,191
Ooh, that's clever, Morty, but I
don't use color to sort things

258
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,360
because I'm not a mouse in
a European children's book.

259
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,529
Then why are all those
pink ones by the liquor?

260
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,097
Liquor?

261
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,507
[Bleep], that was close.
We lost Captain Sky.

262
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,275
He gave his life
for the uprising.

263
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,344
Yeah. It really makes
you think, huh, Morty?

264
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,312
We should never take
things for granite.

265
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,014
- What?
- I'm just saying, life's short.

266
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,549
We shouldn't take things
for granite.

267
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,818
- Are you saying "granite"?
- Well, yeah.

268
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,520
It's "granted,"
with a "D."

269
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,423
Take things for granted.
Did you actually think it was...

270
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,091
Jesus Christ, Rick,

271
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,126
what are you, a boulder...
A rock person?

272
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,162
How long have you been saying
that wrong?

273
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,463
Oh, you like that, huh?

274
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,231
I b-b-bet that really
blows your mind.

275
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,666
I mean, yeah,
it's kind of great.

276
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,069
- You want me to erase it?
- What, you can do that?

277
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,671
Ah, [BLEEP].

278
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,673
I [BLEEP] knew it,
you piece of [BLEEP]!

279
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,176
You... You...
You're a [BLEEP] asshole, Rick!

280
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,644
Take it easy, Morty, come on.
Just relax.

281
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,379
No, I'm not gonna [BLEEP] relax!
Come here!

282
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,014
Let go of me, you little bitch!

283
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,949
I'm gonna grab you by the
scruff of your... Take that!

284
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,718
Ohh!

285
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,419
- Umm.
- Umm. Uhh.

286
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,887
- What...
- What's going on?

287
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,155
- Where am I?
- Who are we?

288
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,356
Who am I?

289
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,325
I think I'm an adolescent boy.

290
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,627
Huh, and I'm an elderly man.

291
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:14,065
And we appear to be in some kind
of secret confined space.

292
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,067
Yeah, umm...

293
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,168
Don't look at me like that.

294
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,170
For all we know, you could be
the [BLEEP] weirdo.

295
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,707
Huh, these things are
obviously storage units,

296
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,676
and since we can't remember
what went wrong,

297
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:27,545
my guess is that the technology
involves memory,

298
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,749
and that this thing on your head
is designed to...

299
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,450
Tell us the code, jagoff!

300
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,487
It's pointless.
He's stonewalling.

301
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,589
Rick, if we don't unlock those
vaccines, Earth dies!

302
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,691
You know, it might be time to
step up your interrogation!

303
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,359
Not sure what
you're implying, Morty,

304
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,194
but some lines I don't cross.

305
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,029
Yeah, well,
I crossed every line I had

306
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,398
when this bastard
tried to kill Jessica!

307
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:53,004
Okay, see those two fleshy sacs
under his chin, Morty?

308
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,106
Grab 'em.

309
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,008
You remember the codes now?

310
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,443
Twist!

311
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,380
Give us the codes, man!
Twist harder, Morty!

312
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,349
Harder!

313
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,618
Okay, let go, let go,
let him breathe.

314
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:09,621
He wants to make a deal.

315
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,723
Half the codes now,
half after you finish.

316
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,925
But can we trust...
Wait, what?

317
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,126
F-Finish what?

318
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,327
Y-You know...

319
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,862
I thought I was torturing him!

320
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,230
Oh, and this disappoints you?

321
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,132
Do I tell him we don't
have a deal, Morty?

322
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,767
Because if we can
kill our enemies,

323
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,270
but we can't jack them off, then
how are we better than them?

324
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,238
Well, what did you find out?

325
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,973
We're partners, I guess,

326
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,242
and we fight aliens,
like "Men in Black"?

327
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,111
"Men in Black,"
"Men in Black."

328
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,013
I have "Men in Black 2" in here.

329
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,514
So... So you get
the general idea.

330
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:37,949
Not quite.

331
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,552
It's basically an endless string
of callbacks to...

332
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,755
All right, save it for Youtube.
I'll keep looking for clues.

333
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,259
What are you doing?

334
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,928
You want your shelf
level or not?

335
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,664
And if I say yes, you're gonna
provide that for me with that?

336
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,765
Yes, see the bubble?

337
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,366
I'm familiar with
the bubble, Morty.

338
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,335
I also dabble in precision,

339
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,270
and if you think
you can even approach it

340
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,905
with your sad, naked,
caveman eyeball

341
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,608
and a bubble of [BLEEP] air,
you're the reason this species

342
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,577
is a failure,
and it makes me angry!

343
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,778
You're drunk.

344
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,413
You want to put up a shelf,
put up a shelf.

345
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,615
You want to experience
true level?

346
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,451
Do you? Y-yes.

347
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,996
Ugh, all right, come on.

348
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,137
Wow, it's so...

349
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,375
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh,
Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.

350
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,944
Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.

351
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,413
Morty, come on,
we're leaving for school.

352
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,649
Oh, everything's crooked!
Reality is poison!

353
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,384
I want to go back!
I hate this!

354
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,785
What's his deal?
Can't live like this!

355
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,420
Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty,
Morty, Morty.

356
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,322
Go to school, Summer.
I'll go in Morty's memory

357
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,757
and do a little...

358
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,126
Lambs to the cosmic slaughter!

359
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,561
Well?

360
00:14:56,563 --> 00:15:00,031
You seem to be in charge
of what I get to remember.

361
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,232
Why?

362
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,834
Good question.

363
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,570
Morty, I need darkness to prime
these optical inductors.

364
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,906
Hit the leftmost light switch
by the door for me.

365
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,173
The left.

366
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,116
Okay, lights on.

367
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,487
So, did I just hear three
distinct light switch clicks?

368
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,988
W-W-What do you mean?

369
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,691
I feel like the three sounds
I heard could be explained

370
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,294
by an initial erroneous flipping
of a switch on the right

371
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,162
followed by a hasty,
corrective flipping

372
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,797
of the requested switch.

373
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,066
Then during the resultant
darkness and silence, a third,

374
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,036
shameful unflipping of
the initially flipped switch.

375
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,771
Is my assessment accurate?

376
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,074
Yeah, that's... that's basically
how... how it all shaked out.

377
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,309
I'm sorry.

378
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,544
Ugh.
All right, come on.

379
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,480
What?!
Come on!

380
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,662
Grab a shovel.

381
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,464
W-What is...

382
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,833
Grab a shovel!

383
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,769
What was that?

384
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,607
I can't find a goddamn
zip tie anywhere!

385
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,043
All right, [BLEEP] it!

386
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,917
Ahh, zip tie.

387
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,135
Why are you making me
do this for you again?

388
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,704
Who doesn't wish they could
talk to animals, Rick?

389
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,805
Most humans!

390
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,841
There, I'm done,
just stay out of trouble!

391
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,844
Gotta keep moving.
Can't stop.

392
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,879
Up, down, down, up, up, up,
down, up, stop, down.

393
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,914
The queen needs food.
The babies need food.

394
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,050
The queen makes babies.

395
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,585
The situation in Argentina

396
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,286
has proven less convenient
than predicted.

397
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,389
We'll have to re-destabilize
their economy,

398
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,724
refocus labor class outrage
from upper to middle,

399
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,160
foster a coup, and install
a compliant regime.

400
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,361
Same as Guatemala?

401
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,529
Yes, but you can double time it.

402
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,031
We need a quorum
to pick a new pope,

403
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,099
in case the Exxon/Monsanto thing
falls through in Africa.

404
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,635
Why not use chemtrails?
Put a canopy on Uganda.

405
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,637
They're set to agitate
any mo... What?

406
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,406
That kid is watching us.

407
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,574
So, we're squirrels, he's a kid.

408
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:26,377
He's watching us like he hears
what we're saying.

409
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,946
Hey, kid. Young man?
Come here, little boy.

410
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,949
Tell Daphne to run a 199
on a possible Dolittle.

411
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,117
Little boy!

412
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,919
We'll give you wishes
if you can hear us!

413
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,021
We can make you fly
and get candy.

414
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,398
Oh, [BLEEP]! Oh, [BLEEP]!
[Bleep] me! [Bleep] me!

415
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,801
Rick!

416
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,236
Ah, [BLEEP], Morty,
what did you do?

417
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,143
All right, Morty,
pack your shit!

418
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,012
That's only gonna keep 'em down
for a little bit, Morty!

419
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,580
You [BLEEP] with
squirrels, Morty!

420
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,981
We got a good five minutes

421
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,783
before they're backing up
on our ass, Morty!

422
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,086
We have to pack up and move
to a new reality, Morty!

423
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,455
You know I said we could
only do that a couple of times!

424
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,724
We're [BLEEP] over here because
of these damn squirrels, Morty!

425
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,726
I don't know what
my reaction is,

426
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,895
but I think I'm mounting
in suspicion of you.

427
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:20,998
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna remember everything!

428
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,101
Everything!

429
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,876
Yeah!

430
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:39,250
Ow!

431
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,252
Ah!

432
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,454
Ow!

433
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,898
Well, what'd you find out?

434
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,967
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what
are you gonna do, kill me?

435
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,803
No, I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill myself!

436
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,671
All those memories just erased!

437
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,740
Sitting in this room
collecting dust!

438
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,743
W-What's the point of going on
if most of everything

439
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,346
that happens just ends up
sitting in here?

440
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,348
All right, kid.

441
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,117
I don't know much aside from
the fact that "Men in Black 2"

442
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,853
is a joyless cash grab, but I do
know that whatever you have

443
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,289
brewing around in your noggin
really connected with you.

444
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,824
I can't deny that,

445
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,260
and I can't deny that I'm
inspired by your passion.

446
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,995
I want in.
Suicide pact!

447
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,930
Yes, yeah, let's do it!

448
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,933
Together, you old son
of a bitch! On three!

449
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,134
One...

450
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:31,302
Two...

451
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:34,172
You guys doing
Morty's Mind Blowers?

452
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,140
Morty's Mind Blowers?

453
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:38,676
Grandpa,
is this scenario three?

454
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,245
Uh, w-what's that,
and w-who are you?

455
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:44,115
Oh, man, it's a scenario four.

456
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,900
Ugh, [BLEEP] goddamn it!

457
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,736
I don't get paid enough
for this shit!

458
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:09,407
<i>There's a Craftsman nearby.
I can smell it.</i>

459
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,409
Whoa, what... what...

460
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,044
<i>Can I help you?</i>

461
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,912
H-How did we fall asleep during
interdimensional cable?

462
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,647
- Yeah, what the hell, Summer?
- Summer, you dumb bitch!

463
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,349
How long were we out,
you dumb bitch!

464
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,184
How much interdimensional cable
did we miss, you stupid bitch!

465
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,286
How many improv TV shows with
commercials did we miss, Summer?

466
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,088
Why did you let us fall asleep?
You dumb bitch! You stupid bitch!

467
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,690
All right, Morty,
[BLEEP] this noise.

468
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,258
Let's get out of here
and go on a classic

469
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,460
Rick and Morty adventure.
Yeah, right, Rick, I'm allin.

470
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,395
No wonder you're
constantly fighting

471
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,264
with each other
and behind schedule.

472
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,999
What?
Nothing.

473
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,561
Rick?
Hello?

474
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,296
Just here for my putter.

475
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:08,532
Jerry's Mind Blowers?

476
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,071
Follow the boys!

477
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,810
We're charged and aimed
at Alpha Centauri,

478
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,746
ready for transport.

479
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,448
They fell for it!
Let's send Gobo home!

480
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,850
All right!

481
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,652
- Where's dad?
- He should be here any second.

482
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,820
It's funny, Jerry spent his life
seeking attention,

483
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,223
but in the end, humanity's
instinctive dismissal of him

484
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,624
saved an alien's life.

485
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,459
He knows where to go, right?

486
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,295
Yep, any minute now.

487
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,134
Did it work?
Did you guys get Gobo home?

488
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,836
You have Gobo! You were supposed
to bring him to the hill!

489
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,605
As if.
He was in your basket.

490
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,373
He was in your car!

491
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,845
Oh!

492
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:57,014
Oof!
Dibs on his stuff.

493
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,051
Did yoof that?
