2
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,500
Run!

3
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,130
Morty, do it!
Hit the button now!

4
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,700
I can't do it, Rick!
They're my parents and sister!

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,030
Morty, I already told
you it's not your family!

6
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,270
They're clones from
an alternate reality,

7
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,330
possessed by demonic alien spirits
from another dimension's future!

8
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,100
Do you need a mnemonic device
or something?

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,480
Just hit the button, already!

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,599
Morty, please, I love
you, sweetheart.

11
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,669
Oh!

12
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:06,600
Good work, Morty.

13
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,130
You know, these demonic alien
spirits are really valuable.

14
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,769
You okay, Morty? I told you
not to trust that tuna.

15
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,230
I just killed my family!

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,600
I don't care what they were.

17
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,870
I don't know, Morty.

18
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,210
Some people'd pay top dollar for
that kind of breakthrough.

19
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,000
You know what, Rick?
That's it!

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,830
I'm done with these insane
adventures!

21
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,730
That was really traumatizing!

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,170
- I quit! I'm out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,206
Come on, Morty, don't
be like that.

24
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:29,830
The universe is a crazy,
chaotic place.

25
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,870
You're the one that's
crazy and chaotic!

26
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,830
Adventures are supposed to be
simple and fun.

27
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,970
Oh, yeah, Morty, yeah.

28
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,960
Yeah, that that that's real easy to
say from the sidekick position.

29
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,270
But but, uh, how about next time...

30
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,200
you be in charge, and then we'll
talk about how simple and fun it is?

31
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,370
Seriously, Rick?

32
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,170
You'll you'll let me call
the shots?

33
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,270
Okay, yeah, fine.

34
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,000
But let's make it
interesting, Morty.

35
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,570
If your adventure sucks
and we bail halfway through it,

36
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,900
you lose the right to bitch
about all future adventures.

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,870
Plus, you have to do my laundry
for a month.

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,670
Okay, all right, tough guy!
But if my adventure's good...

39
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,700
I get to be in charge of
every third adventure!

40
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,600
- Every 10th.
- Deal. All right.

41
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, come on, let's get going.

42
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,000
Dad, the dishwasher's
doing that thing again.

43
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,870
- Washing dishes?
- No. The opposite.

44
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,870
Can you fix it?

45
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,330
Grandpa Rick, can you help me
with my science homework?

46
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,770
- Yeah just don't do it.
- Grandpa!

47
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,070
Hey, Rick, you got
some kind of hand-shaped device

48
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,500
that can open this
mayonnaise jar?

49
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,600
Wow. Hat trick.

50
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,800
All right, Morty, let's put a
pin in this.

51
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,230
I got to help your
pathetic family.

52
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,270
Oh, that sounds like
something a chicken would say.

53
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,030
Bawk, bawk, bawk,
bawk, bawk, bawk.

54
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,700
Oh, Morty, you done did
it this time.

55
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,530
It's on.

56
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,770
I can't wait to watch your
adventure lay a huge fart.

57
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,900
As for you dingdongs...

58
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,730
This is a Meeseeks box.
Let me show you how it works.

59
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,699
You press this.

60
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
Look at me!

61
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,200
You make a request.

62
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,729
Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's
stupid mayonnaise jar.

63
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,830
Yes, siree!

64
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,830
The Meeseeks fulfills
the request.

65
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,870
- All done!
- Wow!

66
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,930
And then it stops existing.

67
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,100
- Oh, my God, he exploded!
- Trust me, they're fine with it.

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,690
Knock yourselves out just
keep your requests simple.

69
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,669
They're not gods.

70
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,600
All right!

71
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,430
Get out of here now!
Everybody out of here!

72
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,900
I got a bet to win!

73
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,230
- So many possibilities.
- My mind is racing.

74
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,600
If we're gonna use this thing,

75
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,390
which I'm not even sure we should,
we need to keep it simple.

76
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,870
- I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
- I want to be popular at school!

77
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,270
- Ooh, okay!
- Summer, what did I just-

78
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,030
Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
Look at me!

79
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,100
I want I want to
be a more complete woman!

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,630
- Beth!
- Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!

81
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,400
You guys are doing it wrong.

82
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,800
He said "simple."

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,199
Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

84
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,230
Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take
two strokes off my golf game.

85
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,900
Ooh, yeah! Can do!

86
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,030
Nailed it.

87
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,800
God, Morty, what a
boring start to an adventure.

88
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,070
Why didn't we
just go to Kentucky?

89
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,590
Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with
creatures and all sorts of fantasy things.

90
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,670
- We're going on a quest, okay?
- Can't wait.

91
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,800
Ahem. Excuse me!

92
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,770
We are two humble heroes
in search of adventure!

93
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,100
Oh, my God, so embarrassing.

94
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,930
At last! Two heroes!
You must help us!

95
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,700
This village is terribly poor,

96
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,230
yet the giant that lives in the
clouds above has untold treasures!

97
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,770
You know what?

98
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,699
I accept your call to
adventure, good sir, kind sir.

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,870
Come on, Rick.

100
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,300
- There's a giant in the clouds!
- Yeah.

101
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,330
Beginner's luck.

102
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,229
In conclusion, a friendship
with Summer Smith is the most

103
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,900
valuable and enriching
experience of your young lives.

104
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,369
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
Look at me!

105
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,200
Thank you!

106
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,670
Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it?

107
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,970
Yeah. Gene Vagina.

108
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,790
Listen, I'm in a bit of custody
thing with my ex and was wondering-

109
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,200
No, I'll get your info
from Summer.

110
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,869
I got pregnant at 17.

111
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,900
I mean, I still put myself
through veterinary school.

112
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,230
Yes, I'm successful, but what if
I hadn't...

113
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,270
I'm just saying,
somewhere along the way,

114
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,570
I lost that wide-eyed
girl from muskegon.

115
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,230
She's still there, Beth.

116
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,630
Well, her waistline isn't.

117
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,970
Beth, having a family doesn't mean
that you stop being an individual.

118
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,900
You know the best thing you can
do for people that depend on you?

119
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,770
Be honest with them, even if it
means setting them free.

120
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,600
You're saying I should
leave Jerry.

121
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,170
I can't believe I'm finally
having this conversation.

122
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,070
More wine?

123
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,800
I think I've had enough.

124
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,000
Remember to square
your shoulders, Jerry.

125
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,700
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

126
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,000
That's okay.

127
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,630
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

128
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,570
Try again and keep your head
down.

129
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,600
Okay, well, which is it?

130
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,630
Square my shoulders or keep my
head down?

131
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,900
Well, it's both.

132
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,900
But most importantly,
you got to relax.

133
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,130
You know what, Mr. Meeseeks?

134
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,330
I don't think this is working.
I give up.

135
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,930
I'm sorry, Jerry, but it
doesn't work like that.

136
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,270
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

137
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,830
I have to fulfill my purpose so
I can go away.

138
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,999
Look at me.

139
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,369
Well, make yourself
comfortable, because I suck.

140
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,730
No, Jerry, I'm the
one who sucks!

141
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,970
Let me try something.

142
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,030
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

143
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,970
Look at me!

144
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,330
Hi, Mr. Meeseeks!

145
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,670
- I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.
- Hi!

146
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,930
Can you help me get two strokes
off of Jerry's golf swing?

147
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,100
Can do!
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

148
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,100
Is he keeping his shoulders
squared?

149
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,070
Ooh, he's trying!

150
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,900
All right, Morty.

151
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,600
We're in your stupid
giant's castle.

152
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,770
What do we do next?

153
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,330
Would you just relax, Rick?

154
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,600
All we got to do is find the
treasure room, okay?

155
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,630
It's nice and simple.

156
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,869
You know, I'm sorry everything's
going so smoothly and adventurously.

157
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,170
Uh-oh, Morty.

158
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,730
Startin' to get a little hairy.

159
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,030
What do you want to do, boss?

160
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,170
Come on, hurry.

161
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,430
Behind this cookie jar.

162
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,130
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

163
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,570
Just give up, Morty.

164
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,830
This is game over.

165
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,100
I'll take us home right now.
You just say the word.

166
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,530
No way, Rick.
This is all part of it.

167
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,300
Adventures have conflict.
Deal with it.

168
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,890
I smell the blood of-
whoop!

169
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,130
- Holy crap.
- Oh, boy.

170
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,870
He looks pretty bad down there,
Morty.

171
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,700
Looks like he's bleeding out.

172
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,200
Oh, Jesus! Dale!

173
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,100
You sons of bitches!

174
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh, man.

175
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,730
Hello, 911?

176
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,129
My husband has been attacked
by tiny people! He's dying!

177
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,369
Hey, look, we get it.

178
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,230
You're little, you're down on your
luck, you think, "hey, he's a giant.

179
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,870
Why don't we break into his
home, rob him, and murder him?"

180
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,830
Th-th but that's not
how it went down!

181
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,730
Oh, well, it's going down
like that.

182
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,030
You're both going down like
that.

183
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,730
Ooh, boy, Morty, you're
really showing me how it's done.

184
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,900
Real straightforward and fun.

185
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,570
Like, letting go of the need

186
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,170
to be popular is what
makes people like you.

187
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,300
The most important love you
can receive is from yourself.

188
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,630
Okay, Jerry, you got to just
choke up on the club!

189
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,370
Well, which is it,
choke up or follow-through?!

190
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,470
Aww, come on, Jerry, we've
been over this.

191
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,030
You know you got to do both!

192
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,300
This is as frustrating for us
as it is for you.

193
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,670
Don't tell me that!

194
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,100
That just puts pressure on me!

195
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,570
- Just try to relax.
- You try to relax!

196
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,900
Have you ever tried to relax?!

197
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,600
It is a paradox!

198
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,830
Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh?

199
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,970
Kind of a handful.

200
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,430
I can't imagine what you two
must be going through.

201
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,100
Our Meeseeks have been
gone for hours, Jerry.

202
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,330
You're kidding me.

203
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,330
Notice anything different?

204
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,600
I'm sorry. Hours?

205
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,800
Dad, mom is a beautiful woman!

206
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,730
Look at her!

207
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,800
You will lose her!

208
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,099
Uhh...

209
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,300
Hey, Jerry, you mind if we
get back to the task at hand?

210
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,930
Meeseeks don't usually have to
exist this long.

211
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,530
It's getting weird.

212
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,200
Order in the court!

213
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,329
Before the jury
reaches its verdict,

214
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,600
I just want to say that
I consider you both very guilty.

215
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,570
Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick
and Morty go to giant prison.

216
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,100
You know, if somebody
drops the soap,

217
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,130
it's gonna land on our heads
and crush our spines, Morty.

218
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,530
You know, it'll be really
easy to rape us after that.

219
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,700
- We're gonna be okay, Rick.
- How?

220
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,770
They took my portal gun.

221
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,570
This is an open-and-shut case,
Morty.

222
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,700
You know, what do you
think's gonna happen,

223
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,100
some magical angel's
gonna show up and then-

224
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,270
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

225
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,029
I smell the violation
of civil liberties!

226
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,030
Your honor, I'm from a
tiny-persons advocacy group

227
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,270
and I have here in my
hand a motion to dismiss.

228
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,370
These little men were never
read their giant rights

229
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,830
and are therefore
free-fi to fo-home.

230
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,400
W-what the hell is he
talking about?

231
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,570
They're free to go, is what I
meant.

232
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,430
I'm deconstructing our
our our thing we say.

233
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,600
We're giants. Nobody got that?
Whatever.

234
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,870
Oh, man, what did I
tell you, Rick?

235
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,730
We did it!

236
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,189
All right, Morty, looks like the
portal gun's still working.

237
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,200
You ready to head home?

238
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,070
Oh, yeah, you'd like
that, wouldn't you, Rick?

239
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,900
Well, you know what?

240
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,000
We're not bailing out just yet.

241
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,770
You know, we're gonna go find
some treasure or something

242
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,230
and and we're gonna bring it
to those villagers.

243
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,400
Morty, cut your losses.

244
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,630
This is obviously a wash.

245
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,500
Yeah, you were saying
that back when we first got arrested,

246
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,170
but here we are, you know, walking
down the courthouse steps.

247
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,300
Oh, boy, Morty.

248
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,289
Usually, walking
down the courthouse steps

249
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:57,470
is the easy part
of the adventure.

250
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,170
What do you say, Morty?

251
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,029
I say give me a hand, sidekick.

252
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,470
Everybody shut up!

253
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,930
Let me try!

254
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,129
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

255
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,100
I'm going out.

256
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,100
Wait. What?

257
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,970
Well, you're busy.

258
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,570
I'm hungry.

259
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,700
I thought I'd go out.

260
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,230
Do you want me to be happy or do
you want me to be in prison?

261
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,030
Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is

262
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,100
I'll take you to dinner.

263
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,170
Hey, you know what?

264
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,270
It's hard being me, too.

265
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,300
I'll be right there.

266
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,300
Look, I've got a
marriage to keep together.

267
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,000
At this point, my golf swing is
more your problem than mine.

268
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,430
I can't take it anymore.
I just want to die!

269
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,430
We all want to die!

270
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,600
We're Meeseeks!

271
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,730
Why did you even
rope me into this?

272
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,200
'Cause he roped me into this!

273
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,700
Well, him over there, he
roped me into this!

274
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,029
Well, he roped me into this!

275
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,430
Well, what about me?

276
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,600
He roped me into this.

277
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,300
Well, that one over there
roped me into this.

278
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,560
Well, he roped me into this.

279
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,169
Yeah, Morty, this is
the part of the story everybody loves

280
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,969
scaling down 650,000
oversized steps.

281
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,570
All right, okay,
you know, if this was a story,

282
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,730
this part wouldn't
be included, stupid.

283
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,530
Hey, Rick, what do you know?
Look down there.

284
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,630
Looks like some kind
of tavern or something

285
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,270
built right into
the side of the step.

286
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,700
Oh, wow, Rick.

287
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,100
Now, this is more like it.

288
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,300
Look, there's little
staircase-shaped people in here.

289
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,129
All kinds of crazy characters.

290
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,770
This place is great, you know?

291
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,270
It's whimsical and fun.

292
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,900
What are you looking at, mother-

293
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,900
Easy, Rick.

294
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,470
Pay them no mind.

295
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,670
Those stair goblins
can be moody.

296
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,300
Now, what can I getcha?

297
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,300
We've got skarlog poppies,

298
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,300
flurlow, halzingers, bloogies,
juicy time babies.

299
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, how
about some scotch whiskey?

300
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,970
You got any of that around here?

301
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,170
Or just a bunch of nonsense
words?

302
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,399
Rick...
We'll have two bloogies, please.

303
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,130
And, uh, we were wondering,

304
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,370
is there a faster way two heroes
could get down these stairs?

305
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,200
Y'all need to ride
down the stairs?

306
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,629
My name is
slippely-slippery stair.

307
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll take you down there for
25 shmeckels.

308
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,870
25 shmeckels?

309
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,730
I don't know how much I
don't know what that is.

310
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,600
Is that a lot? Is it a little?

311
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,600
That's exactly how much I
spent on my big fake boobies.

312
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,070
Hi, I'm Mr. booby buyer.

313
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,270
I'll buy those boobies for
25 shmeckels.

314
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,100
It's a tempting offer, but
I'm gonna have to decline.

315
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,300
Rats! What a shame.

316
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,300
Morty, your adventure's
in a spiral.

317
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,629
For real, man, time to pull out.

318
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,430
You keep heckling my
adventure, Rick!

319
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,000
- You know why?
- Uh, because it's lame?

320
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,570
It's because you're petty!

321
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,030
You know, how many
times have I had

322
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,570
to follow you into some
nonsensical bull crap?

323
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,470
I always roll with the punches,
Rick.

324
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,700
Why can't you?

325
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,729
Look, I got to take a leak, and
when I come back,

326
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,700
if you haven't learned how to
lighten up, don't be here!

327
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,129
Whatever.

328
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,730
It's become clear-look at me-

329
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,500
that if we concentrate all
our efforts on Jerry's follow-through,

330
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,230
we will solve this problem.

331
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,499
- I'm Mr. Meeseeks.
- I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me.

332
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,300
The only thing that's clear

333
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,700
is that choking up is
the one true solution.

334
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,530
Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

335
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,370
I've been trying to help
Jerry for two days,

336
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,230
an eternity in Meeseeks time,
and nothing's worked.

337
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,530
I fear the worst.

338
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,130
Your failures are your own,
old man.

339
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,870
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.

340
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,030
I say follow-through!

341
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,030
Who's with me?!

342
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:15,055
Follow-through!

343
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,129
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

344
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,030
Kill him!

345
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,070
How are you today?

346
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,370
- I'm Mr. jelly bean.
- Hi, Mr. jelly bean.

347
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,370
I'm Morty.

348
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,530
My grandpa and I are on an
adventure.

349
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,300
- Nice. Is it a fun adventure?
- I hope so.

350
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,770
But I'm starting to get nervous

351
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,530
that maybe it's gone a little
too far off the rails.

352
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,070
Isn't that what adventures do?

353
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,269
Hey, you know what?

354
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,670
You're right.
Everything's going fine.

355
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,630
I just got to relax and go with
the flow.

356
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,130
Yeah.

357
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,830
Okay. Uh. B-bye.

358
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,070
Uhh, no, stay.
Go with the flow.

359
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,330
Stop.

360
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,170
You're making me really
uncomfortable.

361
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,070
Stop fighting me.
Just let this happen.

362
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,330
Get off of me!

363
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,130
d Sweet home Alabama d

364
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,100
Whoo!

365
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,170
No! Stop! Please!

366
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,230
Stop being such a
tease, you sweet little-

367
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,670
No! No!

368
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,630
Everybody sto-o-o-p!
Look at me!

369
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,370
My brothers, nothing will be

370
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,230
accomplished by shedding
Meeseeks blood.

371
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,670
None of us can die until our job
is done.

372
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,430
The job can't be done!

373
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,900
We'll never get two strokes off
his game!

374
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,430
No, we won't.

375
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,730
But we will get all strokes off
his game.

376
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,430
Where's he going with this?

377
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,999
What's he mean?

378
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,500
When we kill him.

379
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,270
Jerry, maybe it's time I take
that trip I always talk about.

380
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,600
Where would you go?

381
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,100
I don't know, man.

382
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,930
Italy. Greece. Argentina.

383
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,370
Countries known for their
sexually aggressive men.

384
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,990
Did I tell you how much I
love your new haircut?

385
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,270
What the heck?

386
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,270
There he is!

387
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,299
Run, Jerry!

388
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,730
Come on out, Jerry!

389
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,130
Guys, I'll choke up.
I'll follow through.

390
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,730
I'll do whatever you tell me to
do, okay?

391
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,170
Oh, we're well past that, Jerry.

392
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,830
Come on, Rick, quit stalling.

393
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,530
What do ya got?

394
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,230
Read 'em and weep, fellas!

395
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,230
Oh, hey, Morty.

396
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,400
Listen, I'm really sorry about

397
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,500
all that stuff I said earlier
about your adventure.

398
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,900
I'm havin' a good time, Morty.

399
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,170
- It's not so bad.
- Let's just go home, okay?

400
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,100
I'm calling it.
The adventure's over.

401
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,270
We can't leave now, Morty.

402
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,600
- I'm on fire!
- Look, I want to leave now.

403
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,230
You win the bet, okay?

404
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,870
Just give me the portal gun and
let's go, please.

405
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,200
Please, I just want to go home.

406
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,130
Okay.

407
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,270
Listen, Morty.

408
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,600
I just won a bunch of shmeckels.

409
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,130
Why don't we use 25 of them

410
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,700
to pay slippery stair here for a
ride back to the village,

411
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,401
and then we'll give the rest of the
shmeckels to the villagers, huh?

412
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,770
- Really?
- Sure, Morty. Yeah.

413
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,230
You know, a good adventure needs
a good ending.

414
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,300
Buckle up!

415
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,470
Meeseeks are not born into this
world fumbling for meaning, Jerry!

416
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,270
We are created to serve

417
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,499
a singular purpose for which we will
go to any lengths to fulfill!

418
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,130
Existence is pain to a Meeseeks,
Jerry.

419
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,970
And we will do anything to
alleviate that pain.

420
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,830
Just ask...

421
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,730
Aah!

422
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,530
...what's your name, ma'am?

423
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,400
Samantha. Please, mister!

424
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,070
Give him what he wants!

425
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,330
Innocent people are
going to die because of me.

426
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,830
Why am I so mediocre?

427
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,469
Jerry, turn around.

428
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,770
Straighten your back.

429
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,399
Bend your knees.
Bend them.

430
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,830
Square your shoulders.

431
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,969
Take a deep breath.

432
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,100
I love you.

433
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,100
I'm counting to three, Jerry.

434
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,930
What the is going on?

435
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,370
He's got it!

436
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,870
That's a lower handicap
stro-o-ke!

437
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,170
Excuse me.

438
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,500
I'm a bit of a stickler
Meeseeks.

439
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,300
What about your short game?

440
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,170
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

441
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,830
What about your short game?!

442
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,670
Ooh, nice!

443
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,030
I think we'll take our
food to go.

444
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,000
No, you won't.

445
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,270
The police are coming.

446
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,070
You have so many questions to
answer.

447
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,570
Fair enough.

448
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,070
Thank you, kind sir.

449
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,400
Our village is saved!

450
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,200
You are both true heroes!

451
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,030
Good job, Morty.
Looks like you won the bet.

452
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,430
Thanks, Rick, but I
don't know if I should.

453
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,600
You know, you were right about
the universe.

454
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,130
It's a crazy and chaotic place.

455
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,070
Well, you know, maybe
that's why it could use a little

456
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,330
cleaning up every now
and then, you know.

457
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,330
This one's wrapped up neat and clean
because we did it Morty style.

458
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,600
Oh! Heroes, we would like to
introduce you to our beloved king

459
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,229
so that he may thank you
personally.

460
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,830
Uh, no, I-it's cool.

461
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,730
Rick. Portal. Hurry.

462
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,270
So...

463
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,429
You still thinking about taking
that trip?

464
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,970
Jerry, look.

465
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,270
We don't have a perfect marriage,
but I'm not going anywhere.

466
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,700
When we were in that freezer,

467
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,770
I realized the Meeseeks are like
the guys I went to high school with

468
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,600
willing to say anything
to "complete their task."

469
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,530
Was I one of those guys?

470
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,430
The difference is you
didn't disappear afterwards.

471
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,530
Well...

472
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,770
I got you pregnant.

473
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,070
Yeah...

474
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,530
What the hell happened
to this place?

475
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,970
Uh, your Meeseeks box happened.

476
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,170
They went crazy when
they couldn't take

477
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,100
two strokes off
Jerry's golf game.

478
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,199
He felt terrible.

479
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,230
Hey, it's not my fault
that Jerry's an idiot.

480
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,300
Dad!

481
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,530
Is there anything you can do to
clean this place up?

482
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,970
Well, you know, I do
have a Fleeseeks box.

483
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,970
No. No more boxes.

484
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,030
What?

485
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,870
It just has a mop and some floor
wax in it.

486
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,800
Wubba lubba dub dubs!

487
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,070
Yeah! That's my new thing!

488
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,400
I'm kind of like what's his
name Arsenio.

489
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,000
Isn't that it's what Arsenio
used to say on his show.

490
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,870
Wobble gobba lop bops!

491
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,600
Right?

492
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,030
See you next week, everybody.

493
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't get it.

494
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,770
Sir, I think you're going to
want to see this.

495
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,500
We found it inside a lockbox
inside king jelly bean's closet.

496
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,130
We have to tell the people.

497
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,000
Wait.

498
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,670
Destroy it.

499
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,370
Our people will get more from
the idea he represented...

500
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,069
than from the jelly bean
he actually was.

501
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:05,194
