00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:08,307
Hey, Rick. I have to make a project
for the science fair this weekend.

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,376
- You think you could help me out?
- Whatever.

3
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:14,209
Well, I mean, traditionally, science
fairs are a father-son thing.

4
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:17,049
Well, scientifically,
traditions are an idiot thing.

5
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,552
Morty, I think it would
be fun for you to work on a

6
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:21,520
science project with your dad.

7
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:24,423
Uh...

8
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:27,893
Yeah, dad.
Why don't we do it together?

9
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:28,594
Yes!

10
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,230
You backed the right horse on
this one, son.

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,165
We'll get out the crayons,
brew some coffee,

12
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,701
and knock this thing out
in two or three days.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,808
<i>- What is my purpose?</i>
- Pass the butter.

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,242
Thank you.

15
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,080
Dad, I need a ride to work.

16
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:48,915
Maybe Rick can give
you a ride.

17
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:50,783
I'm helping Morty with science.

18
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:51,918
I'm busy.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,353
Doing what?

20
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:55,722
Uh, anything else.

21
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:59,326
<i>- What is my purpose?</i>
- You pass butter.

22
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:01,027
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

23
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:03,597
Yeah, welcome to
the club, pal.

24
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:35,398

25
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:40,600
- Since when do <i>you</i> have a job?
- Since last week.

26
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,869
It's part-time at this little
vintage thrift store.

27
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:44,337
My boss is this really smart,

28
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:47,707
eccentric old man that treats me
nice and values me.

29
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:48,274
Meow.

30
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:50,910
Can't wait to meet this
fascinating character.

31
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:52,280
Please don't.

32
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:54,680
Oh.

33
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,849
Well, when did this stop being
Jamba Juice?

34
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,887
I've just recently opened for
business, mister, um, Goldenfold.

35
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:04,123
You know my name?
That's disarming.

36
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,893
I also know you long for
female company.

37
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:10,029
You know, it <i>has</i> been lonely
since the divorce.

38
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:12,899
Some voids can't be filled with
Jamba Juice.

39
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:16,969
This aftershave makes a man
quite irresistible to women.

40
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:17,970
Free of charge.

41
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,239
One never pays here--
not with money.

42
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,074
Nothing to read into there.

43
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:22,642
Thanks!

44
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:24,744
Sorry I'm late, mr. Needful.

45
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:28,014
This is my grandpa, Rick.
He was just leaving.

46
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:28,948
Huh.

47
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,983
Tell me, Rick, what
do <i>you desire</i>?

48
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,252
Eh, I make my own stuff.

49
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,087
So, what are you--
like, the devil?

50
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,789
- What? Sorry?
- I don't know.

51
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,759
Store comes out of nowhere, all
the shit's old and creepy.

52
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:40,826
Are you the devil? A demon?

53
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,328
- Leprechaun?
- Grandpa Rick!

54
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,763
Hey, I'm not judging.

55
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:45,831
Just like shoot straight.
I'm a man of science.

56
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,401
Ah, then perhaps you could
make use of this.

57
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:52,939
This microscope reveals things
beyond comprehension.

58
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,381
Grandpa, go home and drink.

59
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,286
Why don't we do a
model of the solar system?

60
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,288
That's what my dad did with me
when I was your age.

61
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,156
Oh, okay.

62
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,292
You know, Rick's in
his lab, making cyborgs and

63
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:16,963
wormholes and all that weird
stuff, but this is real science.

64
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:19,165
A man and his boy,
making planets.

65
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:22,268
Hey, how about we use a
ping-pong ball for Pluto?

66
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,202
And then Jupiter --

67
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:26,305
Uh, actually, I don't
think Pluto's a planet.

68
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,075
Of course Pluto's a planet, son.

69
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:30,810
I learned that in
the third grade.

70
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:32,979
Well, yeah, but you
know they changed it.

71
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,847
Morty, nobody changed
the planets.

72
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,215
I just googled it.

73
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,316
Pluto's not a planet.

74
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,185
They changed it in 2006.

75
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:42,355
Yeah, I heard about
that, Morty.

76
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:44,390
- And I disagree.
- You disagree?

77
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,725
That's right.

78
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:48,027
It's possible to disagree in
science, Morty.

79
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:49,161
Pluto was a planet.

80
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:51,063
Some committee of fancy assholes
disagree.

81
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:51,897
I disagree back.

82
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,032
Give me a ping-pong ball.

83
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,000
Um, okay.

84
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:54,900
I-I just have to...

85
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,370
Go find Rick and
go over my head about Pluto?

86
00:03:57,372 --> 00:03:58,137
No.

87
00:03:58,139 --> 00:03:59,872
Geez, I just got to go to the
bathroom.

88
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:00,840
Damn.

89
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:01,741
Oh.

90
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:03,009
Okay, good.

91
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,077
This is gonna be fun.

92
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:09,849
Hey, Morty, let me ask you
a question real quick.

93
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:13,052
Does evil exist, and if so, can
one detect and measure it?

94
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:13,819
Um...

95
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,254
Rhetorical question, Morty.

96
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,390
The answer's "yes, you just have
to be a genius".

97
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:17,890
Cute.

98
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:19,158
Your sister's boss
gave me a microscope

99
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
that would have made
me retarded.

100
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:22,428
Ooh.
Oh, boy, Rick.

101
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,897
I'm don't think you're allowed
to say that word, you know?

102
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,329
Morty, I'm not disparaging
the differently abled.

103
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:29,869
I'm stating the fact that if I
had used this microscope,

104
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:31,370
it would have made me
mentally retarded.

105
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:34,102
Okay, yeah, but I don't think
it's about logic, Rick.

106
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,375
I think the word has just become
a symbolic issue for powerful

107
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,377
groups that feel like they're
doing the right thing.

108
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,412
Well, that's retarded.

109
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:41,047
What are you guys
talking about?

110
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:42,048
Apparently, nothing.

111
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,016
You asked him if
Pluto's a planet, didn't you?

112
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,184
- No!
- It's not.

113
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:46,786
- Shut up, Rick.
- Whoa.

114
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,387
I don't care what anyone says.

115
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,290
If it <i>can</i> be a planet,
it can be a planet <i>again</i>.

116
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,224
<i>Planet</i>.

117
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,360
Planet, planet, planet.

118
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:56,531
Stay scientific, Jerry.

119
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:02,401
This aftershave made women want
me, but it also made me impotent!

120
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:05,237
A price for everything,
mr. Goldenfold.

121
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:08,074
A price for everything.

122
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:10,876
Oh, my God!

123
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:13,879
How could I not see this
coming?!

124
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,083
My lust!

125
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,919
My greed!

126
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,420
I deserved this!

127
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,488
I deserved this!

128
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,487
This serum should counteract
the negative effects.

129
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:26,425
Holy cats!

130
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,227
Ladies, let's get out of here.

131
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,763
I haven't learned a thing!

132
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:31,430
Here.

133
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,432
You can have this back.

134
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,333
You didn't use it?

135
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,135
Sure I did -- to develop this.

136
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:39,438
It detects and catalogs all your
"twilight zone", "ray bradbury",

137
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,341
"Friday the 13th" the series
voodoo crap magic.

138
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,509
I thought you might want it so

139
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,411
you didn't accidentally sell
anybody, say...

140
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:49,281
A typewriter that generates
best-selling murder mysteries

141
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:51,851
and then makes the murders
happen in real life?

142
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:52,785
- Ooh.
- Be quiet.

143
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:55,784
Don't you want to make sure people
know what they're getting?

144
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,156
You're not intentionally
selling...

145
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,961
beauty cream that makes ugly ladies
pretty but also makes them blind?

146
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:03,963
I find this all quite
preposterous.

147
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:05,331
Oh, I say, good sir.

148
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,165
Oh, harrumph.

149
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,868
Oh, oh

150
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:10,469
Oh, oh that's beautiful.

151
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:13,005
You know it's gonna be wearing
you in three hours?

152
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,040
Do I need to call the police?

153
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,475
Here, you can use my phone.

154
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:19,345
Don't worry. It won't make you
deaf because I'm not a hack.

155
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,451
You think you're so great,
you stupid piece of shit.

156
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:26,886
Stop! Hey!

157
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:27,553
[Beep] you, man.

158
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,321
Stop it right now!

159
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,390
Grandpa Rick, I like working
here.

160
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,625
You work for the devil.

161
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:33,826
So what?

162
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:34,860
"So what?"

163
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,196
Yes, so what if he's
the devil, Rick?

164
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:38,564
At least the devil has a job.

165
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,033
At least he's active in the
community.

166
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:42,001
What do you do?

167
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:44,069
You eat our food and make
gadgets.

168
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,072
Buh-bye.

169
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:47,973
Whoops.

170
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:51,210
I'm sorry, mr. Needful.

171
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:52,044
I'll clean that up.

172
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:53,245
I don't know what I can do about

173
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,014
the ghost lady that came out of
it, but --

174
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:55,514
It's fine.

175
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,483
Summer, you know, your
grandfather's right.

176
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,351
This store curses people.

177
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,319
That's my business.

178
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,353
Well, yeah.

179
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,888
Fast-food gives people diabetes,

180
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,523
and clothing stores have
sweatshops.

181
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:07,193
Is there a company hiring
teenagers that <i>isn't</i> evil?

182
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:08,527
This is my first job.

183
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,996
You've been nice to me,
mr. Needful.

184
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,331
You respect me.

185
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,667
Please, call me "the devil".

186
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,268
I'd rather not, actually.

187
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,103
Yes, perhaps not during
business hours.

188
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:22,274
I told you, I want to file a
declaration that Pluto is a planet.

189
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,977
Well, then my son's going to
fail his science class,

190
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:27,513
and when that happens,
I'm suing you first.

191
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:29,548
I think I know what the "a" in
NASA stands for.

192
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,183
Dad, what's your endgame?

193
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:32,351
Ain't no game, sucka.

194
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:35,254
Why don't we just make the solar
system with eight planets?

195
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,222
It's even easier.

196
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:39,091
Sure, sure, and why
don't we just burn Galileo at

197
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:41,227
the stake for saying
the sun is round?

198
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,462
Science isn't always easy,
Morty.

199
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,598
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

200
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,300
What the hell?!

201
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,083
I'm king Flippy Nips,
ruler of Pluto.

202
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,584
We discovered you quite by

203
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,954
accident during routine
surveillance of your world.

204
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,457
You really gave it to those guys
at NASA.

205
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,259
I was -- you know,

206
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:16,095
sometimes science is about
conviction.

207
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:17,963
I'd like to introduce you to

208
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,432
a few people that very much
agree with you.

209
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,467
Oh, I...

210
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:23,502
Plutonians.

211
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,505
Jerry Smith is a
scientist from earth,

212
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:30,309
where he's creating a
model of our solar system.

213
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,445
Jerry, tell Pluto about your
decision.

214
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,982
Um... Pluto's a planet.

215
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,253
Pluto's a [beep] planet, bitch!

216
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,121
Oh, man.

217
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,924
This is definitely gonna go to
his head.

218
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:49,430
If it's athletic prowess you desire,
principle vagina, I might --

219
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:50,965
- I'll take it.
- But I haven't even --

220
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:55,069
Thank you very, very much.
Great store. Great place. Bye.

221
00:08:55,071 --> 00:08:57,004
Huh. Okay.

222
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:59,873
I must say, summer, I thought
your grandfather's outburst

223
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,275
would have disrupted business,

224
00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:03,944
but this is the best weekend
I've had since salem.

225
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:04,745
Nice.

226
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:07,047
- "Wholesome delight" for lunch?
- Is that the vegan place?

227
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,850
- Yeah, I love their soup.
- I'm kind of soup-ed out.

228
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:11,752
Mrs. Tate, is it?

229
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:13,754
What do you desire?

230
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:15,189
Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey.

231
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:16,390
Oh, is there a limit?

232
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:17,891
Everything's free, right?

233
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:21,395
Let's just say you
don't pay... with money.

234
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:23,263
That was perfect.

235
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:25,432
You pay with the
curses, right?

236
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,101
Um... I -- well...

237
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:30,371
But, mrs. Tate, why do you want
cursed items?

238
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:33,407
Well, I'm going to get the curses
removed at "Curse Purge Plus".

239
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,409
You know, the guy on TV?

240
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,478
What?

241
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,047
<i>Have you acquired
creepy specific old stuff from</i>

242
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:42,816
<i>a mysterious antique or thrift
store that gives you powers but</i>

243
00:09:42,818 --> 00:09:44,918
<i>[beep] with you in
unforeseeable ways?</i>

244
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,720
<i>Bring it to "Curse Purge Plus".</i>

245
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:49,790
<i>I use science to
un-curse the items for cash,</i>

246
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,392
<i>and you get to
keep the powers.</i>

247
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:52,493
<i>This guy got mysterious</i>

248
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:54,928
<i>sneakers to make him run
faster, but guess what?</i>

249
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,065
<i>He would have had to run until
he died, making them worthless.</i>

250
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,400
<i>I removed the curse, making</i>

251
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:01,969
<i>them worth, like, I don't know,
$8 million.</i>

252
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:03,237
<i>See you at the olympics.</i>

253
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:06,469
<i>This eerily intelligent doll was
threatening to murder its family.</i>

254
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:07,841
<i>Now it does their taxes.</i>

255
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:09,009
<i>Everything's deductible.</i>

256
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:11,245
<i>Don't pay for cool
stuff with your soul.</i>

257
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:12,246
<i>Pay for it with money.</i>

258
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:15,082
<i>You know, like how every other
store in the world works?</i>

259
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:17,351
<i>We're located at First and Main
in old town.</i>

260
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:18,752
Come on -- come on down.

261
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:20,020
"First and..."

262
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:22,856
That's right across the street

263
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:26,260
from "Needful Things," where you
can get evil items for free!

264
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:29,997
Diabolic son of a motherf--

265
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:32,266
We're back on
"Good morning, Pluto."

266
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:35,169
And a very good morning it is
for our guest,

267
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:38,806
earth scientist Jerry Smith, who's
making headlines with his bold

268
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:41,108
announcement that is what,
Jerry?

269
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,943
Pluto is a planet.

270
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:45,479
- Well, how about that.
- I love it.

271
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:47,514
Morty Smith.

272
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:48,949
I'm Scroopy Noopers.

273
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:49,950
I'm a scientist.

274
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:52,953
- Can I show you something?
- Uh, I better not.

275
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:54,722
Right now.

276
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:58,125
The center of Pluto, mr. Smith,

277
00:10:58,127 --> 00:11:00,360
is made of a substance called
"Plutonium".

278
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:04,198
Mines like these suck Plutonium
up to the cities,

279
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,766
where corporations use
it to power everything,

280
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:09,870
from diamond cars to
golden showers.

281
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:13,574
And the more we remove,
the more Pluto shrinks.

282
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:16,877
There it goes again.
Just shrank a little.

283
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,880
But a few years ago, your
scientists noticed Pluto had

284
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:23,183
gotten so small they couldn't
even call it a "planet" anymore.

285
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:25,052
Should've been our wake-up call.

286
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:27,087
But the rich Plutonians
won't wake up,

287
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:29,556
and they love your dad
telling everyone Pluto's a

288
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:33,393
planet because that means they
can keep mining until Pluto goes

289
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:38,366
from planet to asteroid to
meteor, and finally...

290
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:40,167
Um, a party?

291
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:42,035
Is everyone in your family
an idiot?

292
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:44,037
Well, for sure me and
my dad are.

293
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:47,559
Well, all you have to do
is get him to admit that,

294
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:50,244
and you could save
four billion lives.

295
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:55,213
Yeah, you know, the thing is
my dad's <i>really</i> insecure.

296
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:58,552
Hmm. Funny.

297
00:11:58,554 --> 00:12:01,254
Mr. Needful, out of
everything in the store,

298
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:03,824
you'll never guess
what we couldn't get rid of.

299
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:07,060
Oh, my god.

300
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:10,898
Oh, my god.

301
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,569
I wish this desk was lighter.

302
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:17,539
I wish this knot was looser.

303
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:20,440
Come on.

304
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:23,110
I don't --

305
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,113
Wait, what am I doing?

306
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:28,415
I wish I knew CPR.

307
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:29,549
1, 2, 3.

308
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:33,220
Oh, Jesus.
What a waste of a monkey paw.

309
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:37,391
Mr. Needful, how could you even think
of doing something so horrible?

310
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:38,292
I'm the devil.

311
00:12:38,294 --> 00:12:40,994
What should I do when I
fail -- get myself an ice cream?

312
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:42,396
You haven't failed.

313
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:44,565
People like Rick are making
me obsolete.

314
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,566
I mean, seriously.

315
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:49,136
I may be "the devil",
but your grandpa is the devil.

316
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:50,437
I just want to go back to hell,

317
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,439
where everyone thinks
I'm smart and funny.

318
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:54,141
No!
It's not fair.

319
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,640
Everyone in this town got something
they wanted from you -- even Rick.

320
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:01,081
I was your only friend,
and I get nothing?

321
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,116
Okay.
I'll give you one thing.

322
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:05,886
- Name it.
- I want to help you.

323
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:06,587
Clever twist.

324
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,323
I learned from the
best, you old fart.

325
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:11,458
Now, let's go get
you hydrated.

326
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,960
Looks like we've

327
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:16,163
got... haunted boxing gloves that
will make you the heavyweight

328
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,408
champion in 1936, and
then you'll be trapped

329
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:20,601
there, winning the same
fight for eternity.

330
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:23,303
I can take out the "eternity"
and the padding,

331
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:25,272
and then you'll have some
time-traveling mittens.

332
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:27,040
Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby.

333
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:30,377
- How's business?
- Here's the last of our inventory.

334
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:33,280
We're going to file chapter 11
and do some restructuring.

335
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,549
Sounds like code for
"you win, Rick."

336
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:37,351
That was important to
you, wasn't it?

337
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:38,018
Nope.

338
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,486
It was important to your dumb
devil friend.

339
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:41,054
To me, this was all just a bit,

340
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:43,987
like when bugs bunny [beep] with
the opera singer for 20 minutes.

341
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:45,392
He tried to kill himself.

342
00:13:45,394 --> 00:13:46,560
Seriously?

343
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:47,961
Holy crap.

344
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:49,129
Holy crap.

345
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:50,964
But you know what,
grandpa Rick?

346
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:52,666
He's strong, and he's never
going to give up.

347
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:54,334
Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care.

348
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:55,302
Oh, I know.

349
00:13:55,304 --> 00:13:57,037
Everyone knows you don't care.

350
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:57,704
So?

351
00:13:57,706 --> 00:14:00,007
So have fun not caring.

352
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:01,475
- I always do.
- Good.

353
00:14:01,477 --> 00:14:03,644
Yeah, it is good.
It's the best.

354
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:05,145
I'm sure it is.

355
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:06,980
- Bye.
- Later.

356
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:09,416
I'm here to pick up my
undead cat and child.

357
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:11,652
Yeah, uh... Give me a sec.

358
00:14:11,654 --> 00:14:14,021
These are the forms for the
employee health plan.

359
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:18,126
All right, yeah, put --
put them on my... Eh.

360
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:21,396
I just got bored.
Everybody out.

361
00:14:22,598 --> 00:14:24,130
All right, just
one more rally,

362
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:26,500
then I promise we'll get back
to your science project.

363
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:28,168
Dad, Pluto isn't a planet.

364
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,670
It's shrinking because of
corporations.

365
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,204
Yeah, that's what that

366
00:14:31,206 --> 00:14:33,373
anti-planet nut job
Scroopy Noopers was screaming

367
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,575
about outside the
ministry of money's fundraiser.

368
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:38,245
Are you telling me four billion
Plutonians are wrong?

369
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:40,347
You said science wasn't easy.

370
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:42,516
I said science isn't
always easy.

371
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:45,085
Obviously, that means
sometimes it <i>is</i> easy.

372
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,753
Let's not debase ourselves with
word games, son.

373
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,522
Dad, their whole
planet is dying.

374
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:49,189
Ha!

375
00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:50,791
You called it a planet.

376
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:52,526
Checkmate.

377
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:54,094
What's up, Pluto?

378
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:01,735
Mr. Smith, please tell my friend
here what you just told me.

379
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:02,302
Go on.

380
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:05,405
My very eager mother
just served us nine pickles,

381
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:06,573
and the "pickles" is Pluto.

382
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,443
My god, the man's a genius.

383
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:11,378
Um, excuse me.

384
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,246
Morty, what?

385
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:15,716
Dad, what did you
think about the recent report

386
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:21,221
published by the Pluto science reader
linking Pluto-quakes, sinkholes,

387
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:26,660
and surface shrinkage to
deep-core Plutonium drilling?

388
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,830
Well, son, what did
you think when you were 5

389
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:32,733
and you pooped your pants, and you
threw your poopy undies

390
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:34,665
out your bedroom window because
you thought it was

391
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:36,528
like throwing something
in the garbage?

392
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:38,572
I mean, I'm trimming
the hedges,

393
00:15:38,574 --> 00:15:40,407
and these things are just
hanging there.

394
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:43,076
Was I supposed to think the poop
bunny left them?

395
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:45,513
Good one, dad.

396
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:48,782
Hey, Morty, you want to
go on a... Oh.

397
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:50,250
Hey, Beth.
Hello?

398
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:53,353
Hey, Jerry, you in here being
stupid?

399
00:15:59,261 --> 00:16:00,594
Thanks.

400
00:16:00,596 --> 00:16:02,162
Hey, you know, I was thinking,

401
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:03,597
you know, I might watch a movie.

402
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,432
<i>I am not programmed for
friendship.</i>

403
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:06,767
Suit yourself.

404
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:11,671
Hey. Hey.

405
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:12,706
W-w-what's going on?

406
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:16,777
Um, listen, can you help me do
the stupid science fair project?

407
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:18,512
Whatever.

408
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:21,648
Jerry, you must be so excited.

409
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,449
The Pluto-bel prize is the highest
honor a scientist can receive.

410
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:28,722
I'm flattered and humbled.

411
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,123
Oh, I like that.

412
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,525
Use that in your speech.

413
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:34,194
Also, talk about Pluto
being a planet.

414
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:35,362
People like that.

415
00:16:35,364 --> 00:16:37,197
Your highness, we've captured
Scroopy Noopers.

416
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,698
You animals! Animals!

417
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,570
Ooh, look who's little
journey's come to an end.

418
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:45,472
Take him to Pluto-namo bay.

419
00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:47,908
You can't kill the truth,
father.

420
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,142
What?

421
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:50,811
I can see you're confused.

422
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:54,677
Pluto-namo bay is a military prison--
a sort of play on words.

423
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:56,683
Did he call you "father"?

424
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:59,820
Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet
nut job, is your son?

425
00:16:59,822 --> 00:17:02,489
The young eat the old if you
let them, Jerry.

426
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,891
Pluto is a cold, cold
celestial dwarf.

427
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:06,493
It's a what?

428
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:07,827
Huh? Oh, planet.

429
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:11,595
"Pluto is a cold,
cold planet".

430
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,366
That's what I meant.

431
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:16,670
Knock them dead
out there, you.

432
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:20,774
Pluto is...

433
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:34,521
...Not a planet.

434
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:35,355
Ow!

435
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:37,257
It's not a planet.

436
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:37,858
Hey!

437
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,360
It's not a planet!

438
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:42,429
I'm an idiot,
and I love my son.

439
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:44,531
It was a long six hours, but

440
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,867
we've overhauled
"Needful Things"

441
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,935
into the globally-compliant
web 4.0,

442
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:55,375
"e-nomenon", "n33dful.com", spelled
with threes instead of "e"'s.

443
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:57,711
- Whoo, yeah!
- Whoo, excited!

444
00:17:57,713 --> 00:17:58,778
Okay, that's it.

445
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,748
We just got bought by Google!

446
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,949
Mm.

447
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:05,252
I'm so proud of you, Lucius.

448
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:07,220
So, how much did we make?

449
00:18:07,222 --> 00:18:08,889
"We".

450
00:18:08,891 --> 00:18:10,624
This is <i>my</i> business.

451
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:11,591
Security!

452
00:18:12,094 --> 00:18:13,560
You're Zuckerberg-ing me?

453
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:16,329
I was Zuckerberg-ing people before
Zuckerberg's balls dropped.

454
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:17,898
I'm the devil, bitch!

455
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,599
What, what?!

456
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:23,570
Hey!

457
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:25,272
Hey!

458
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,512
- Hey, Morty.
- Oh, oh, hey, dad.

459
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:33,313
Um, what -- what are you doing
back from Pluto so quick?

460
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:36,516
Uh... Some people just
can't handle the truth.

461
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:38,285
Especially dummies like me.

462
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:41,788
Morty, I'm not as smart as your
grandpa Rick, but

463
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,357
I promise never to make
that your problem again.

464
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,592
Hey, dad.

465
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:48,762
Nobody's smarter than Rick,
but nobody else is my dad.

466
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:50,630
You're a genius at that.

467
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:51,798
Wow.

468
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:56,403
That's... humbling and
flattering, son.

469
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:57,938
Thank you.

470
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,941
What say we finish ourselves an
eight-planet solar system?

471
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:04,477
Um... I'm just gonna take
this thing in and get an "A".

472
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:04,945
<i>Butter.</i>

473
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:05,779
But...

474
00:19:05,781 --> 00:19:07,781
You're a genius at
being my dad, dad.

475
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:08,848
Quit while you're ahead.

476
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,550
And also, knock next time,
you know?

477
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:12,182
I mean, I'm sitting
in here, I'm 14 --

478
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,687
I got a computer
in here, you know?

479
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:15,488
Oh, I -- I think I understand.

480
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,792
You're really playing with fire when
you burst in here like that, man.

481
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:20,060
I get it. Say no more.

482
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:21,461
I mean, one of these days,

483
00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:23,663
you know, you're gonna end
up seeing something.

484
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:24,564
I got it!

485
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:25,999
Noted. Good night.

486
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,972
How's your pretend
grandpa doing, aka "the devil"?

487
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:33,506
He dumped me.

488
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:35,542
Oof. Sorry.

489
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:37,811
Did we learn a lesson
here I'm not seeing?

490
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:38,645
Not sure.

491
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:42,315
Maybe in a much bigger way,
mr. Needful gave us

492
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:43,650
both what we really wanted?

493
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:46,820
Because I was always jealous of
you hanging out with Morty,

494
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:50,423
and you didn't realize how
much you valued my approval?

495
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:52,692
- No, that's dumb.
- Yeah, not satisfying.

496
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:54,561
I'll tell you what, though.

497
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:55,996
If -- if -- if it's satisfaction

498
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:57,497
you're after, I think I might

499
00:19:57,499 --> 00:19:58,098
have an idea.

500
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:00,333
Uh-huh.

501
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:03,436
Uh-huh, totally. Let's do it.

00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:08,537

door, it's real d

506
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,046

stainless steel d

507
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:14,881
d go hard, getting
busy with it d

508
00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:16,116
d but I got such a good heart d

509
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:18,618

510
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,841

d I'll break who you -- d

515
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,513
And that's how I
took my storefront

516
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,628
into the forefront
of the up front.

517
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:34,167
Thank you, Seattle.

518
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:38,405
Rick? Summer?

519
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,574
Stupid mother [beep].

520
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:42,876
You stupid bitch.

521
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:46,880
How do you like that?

522
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:51,084
W-w-why?

523
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:53,953
Because sometimes
what you <i>really</i> need is for

524
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,389
someone else to pay
a horrible price.

525
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:02,562
- We did it.
- Yeah, bro.

526
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:03,897
We totally worked it.

527
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:06,499
- Yeah.
- We just pulled it off.

528
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:09,736
Yeah, bro.
Yeah.

529
00:21:42,638 --> 00:21:46,706

you cats did was came out to play d
