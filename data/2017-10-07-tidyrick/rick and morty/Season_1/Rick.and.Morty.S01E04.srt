00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,369
This is just sloppy
craftsmanship.

3
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,600
Hey, Rick.

4
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,500
Boy, sure is really especially
beautiful out there today, huh?

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,530
Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost
unbelievable, isn't it?

6
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:43,729
Yeah, you know?

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,869
There's something about the air
and just the way the sunshine is.

8
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,969
Uh, sure, buddy. Yeah.

9
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,469
Sure. Brilliant.

10
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,769
- Very convincing.
- Convincing?

11
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,229
Oh. Responsive, too.
In real time. I love it.

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,369
Uhh... okay.

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,130
I'm going to work.

14
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,670
Morty, good morning.
Dad, good morning.

15
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,469
I am going to work. Goodbye.

16
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,530
- What's with mom?
- Oh, what's with mom?

17
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:05,530
So, you're saying that she's
acting weird?

18
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,170
How sophisticated.

19
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:08,230
Careful, guys.

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,929
You're gonna burn out the CPU
with this one.

21
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,569
Okay, you know what, Rick?
You're acting weird, too.

22
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,500
Whatever,
quote-unquote "Morty."

23
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,230
All right, well...
I'll see you after school.

24
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,530
Ow! Oof! Ugh!

25
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:20,599
Damn it!

26
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,600
I'm all right. I'm okay.

27
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,129
All right, who can tell me
what 5 x 9 is?

28
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:30,129
Morty?

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,400
Uh, me?

30
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,769
What is 5 x 9?

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,230
Umm... you know, it's
uhh... at least 40.

32
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,429
Morty, that's exactly correct!

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,170
5 x 9 is at least 40!

34
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,700
Come up here.

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,329
Whoo! Way to go, Morty!

36
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:46,899
Everybody, this is the best
student.

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,969
I want you to be
the teacher today.

38
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:49,629
Teach us, Morty!

39
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,730
Interesting.

40
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,429
What do you want
me to teach you?

41
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,370
Ooh, ooh!

42
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,599
How do you make concentrated
dark matter?

43
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,230
Oh, that's a good question.

44
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,670
Concentrated huh?

45
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:02,589
Concentrated dark matter the fuel
for accelerated space travel.

46
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,400
Now, do you know how to make it?

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,100
Umm...

48
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,400
Come on, Morty.

49
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,700
Isn't your grandpa, like,
a scientist?

50
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,969
Oh, yeah, but, you
know, he told me

51
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,069
that I shouldn't go
around spouting off about,

52
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,370
you know, his science and stuff.

53
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:16,500
I bet you've seen him make
concentrated dark matter a lot.

54
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,199
You know, if you tell us, I'll
be your girlfriend.

55
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,330
Uh, y-you will?

56
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,930
Seems like a rare
opportunity, Morty.

57
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:24,800
Morty, u-uh, come on.

58
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,969
- There's a family emergency.
- Stop right there!

59
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,430
If he leaves, I'm
giving him an "F".

60
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,870
- He doesn't care.
- Aw, man!

61
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,269
Rick, I have to go back!

62
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:32,530
I think I was about to get
married!

63
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,469
Ugh!

64
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,530
Take a shower with me, Morty.

65
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,770
- What?!
- Listen to me, Morty.

66
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,829
Get your clothes off and get in
the shower right now.

67
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:40,300
You got to trust me, Morty.

68
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,000
Ugh!

69
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,569
I'm gonna get an "F"
in class, Rick.

70
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,569
Morty, that's not class.
That wasn't your teacher.

71
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,599
This isn't your school.

72
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,000
This entire world
is not the world.

73
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,400
We're inside a huge simulation
chamber on an alien spaceship.

74
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,500
Wait a minute.

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,630
W-what are you talking about?

76
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,000
It's all fake, Morty all of it.

77
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,669
Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of
crazy fake nonsense, Morty.

78
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:00,530
I couldn't say so until we got
in the shower.

79
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,670
They won't monitor us in here.

80
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,300
Monitor us?! W-who?!

81
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,629
Zigerion scammers, Morty.

82
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,369
The galaxy's most ambitious,
least successful con artists.

83
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,329
You know, it's lucky for us

84
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:11,469
they're also really
uncomfortable with nudity.

85
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,600
Aw, come on, Rick.

86
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,001
If everyone's just
gonna be insane today,

87
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:15,699
at least let me be
insane with Jessica.

88
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,469
I can't let you do that, Morty.

89
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,400
Give it to me!

90
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:19,169
No!

91
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:20,000
You give it to me!

92
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,000
G-g-give it! No, Rick!

93
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,229
Oh, God, sir!

94
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,129
They're still naked!

95
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,930
Ugh.

96
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:36,030
Well, check every five quintons
and tell me when they're not.

97
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,099
I think we should make Kevin
look, sir.

98
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,030
What?! No!

99
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,730
Why would you even say that?

100
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,900
Uh, sir, we have a situation
over here.

101
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,030
If there's a wiener on that monitor,
I swear to God, stu...

102
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,530
Something is drawing a lot of
processing power.

103
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,730
Oh, wait. No wonder.

104
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,400
There's another real human in
the simulator.

105
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,629
Okay, Jerry big pitch meeting.

106
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,670
Make-or-break time.

107
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,700
You can do this.

108
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,599
How did this happen?!

109
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,000
Where's the abductions
department?

110
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,729
Hey, man, abductions just
follows the acquisition order.

111
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,599
Don't put this on acquisitions!

112
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,000
We only acquire humans that
haven't been simulated!

113
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,330
Well, simulations doesn't simulate
anybody that's been abducted, so...

114
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,469
Oh, I see! Oh, oh!
It was no one's fault.

115
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,099
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry.

116
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,300
Well, then, problem solved.

117
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,129
Oh, wait no.

118
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,100
There's still another
human in here!

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,329
Who is he?

120
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,470
Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith.

121
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,070
So far, he hasn't noticed he's
in a simulation.

122
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,329
Well, cap his sector
at 5% processing,

123
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,769
keep his settings on auto, and
we'll deal with him later.

124
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,500
Rick Sanchez is the target.

125
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:35,769
Got to relax.

126
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,170
It's just a pitch.

127
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,009
Got to relax.

128
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,030
<i>This is earth radio.</i>

129
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,530
<i>And now, here's... human music.</i>

130
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,300
Hmm. Human music.

131
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,069
I like it.

132
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,770
Rick!

133
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,870
Uhp, uhp, uhp!

134
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,630
Morty, keep your hands off your
ding-dong!

135
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,099
It's the only way we
can speak freely.

136
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,230
Look around you, Morty.

137
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,500
Do you really think
this world is real?

138
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,000
You'd have to be an idiot not to
notice all the sloppy details.

139
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,169
Look that guy's putting a bun
between two hot dogs.

140
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:19,569
I don't know, Rick.

141
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,070
I mean, I've seen
people do that before.

142
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,630
Well, look at that old lady.

143
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:24,070
She's she's walking a cat on
a leash.

144
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,170
Uh, Mrs. Spencer does
that all the time, Rick.

145
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:28,529
Look, I-I-I don't want to hear
about Mrs. Spencer, Morty!

146
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,500
She's an idiot!

147
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,729
All right, all right, there.

148
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,899
What about that, Morty?

149
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,870
Okay, okay, you got me
on that one.

150
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:34,870
Oh, really, Morty?

151
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:37,000
Are you sure you haven't seen that
somewhere in real life before?

152
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,830
No, no.
I haven't seen that.

153
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,000
I mean, why would a pop tart want
to live inside a toaster, Rick?

154
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:44,670
I mean, that would be, like, the
scariest place for them to live.

155
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:45,600
You know what I mean?

156
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,000
You're missing the point, Morty.

157
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,899
Why would he drive a smaller
toaster with wheels?

158
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,440
I mean, does your car look like
a smaller version of your house?

159
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:52,199
No.

160
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,530
So, why are they doing this?

161
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,500
W-what do they want?

162
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,669
Well, that would be

163
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,809
obvious to you, Morty, if you'd
been paying attention.

164
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:02,500
We got the President of the
United States in here!

165
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,529
We need 10cc of concentrated
dark matter, stat, or he'll die!

166
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,930
Concentrated dark matter?

167
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,600
They were asking
about that in class.

168
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,505
Yeah, it's a special fuel
I invented to travel

169
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:12,134
through space faster
than anybody else.

170
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:14,669
These zigerions are always
trying to scam me out of my secrets,

171
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,000
but they made a big
mistake this time, Morty.

172
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,100
They dragged you into this.

173
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,529
- Now they're gonna pay!
- What do you...

174
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,829
What are we gonna do?

175
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,730
We'll scam the scammers, Morty.

176
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,269
And we're gonna take them for
everything they've got.

177
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,930
National apple farmers of America,
welcome to our ad agency.

178
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,329
I'm Jerry Smith.

179
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,200
All right.

180
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,030
I'll just... get to the pitch.

181
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,830
Um, simple question, gentlemen,
what are apples?

182
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,629
Excuse me.

183
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:48,699
What are apples?

184
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,000
Apples are food.

185
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,029
And... when do we need food?

186
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,370
When we're hungry.

187
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:59,899
With that, I give you
your new slogan!

188
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:02,729
Well, say something!

189
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,630
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

190
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:06,930
- You do?
- Yes.

191
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:09,099
So... I sold it?

192
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,829
I sold the idea?

193
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,729
- Yes.
- Oh, my God! Thank you!

194
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,569
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

195
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,200
Hey!

196
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,870
I just sold my first pitch!

197
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:25,399
Slow down!

198
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:25,940
Lookin' good.

199
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,329
My man!

200
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:31,169
Hello.

201
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,699
Guess who just sold
the apples campaign.

202
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,700
Who just sold the
apples campaign?

203
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,730
Me!

204
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,970
I guess it wasn't a rip-off of
"got milk?" after all.

205
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,029
- Guess someone was wrong.
- Yes.

206
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,569
Well, all is forgiven,
because right now,

207
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,729
I've got an erection the size of an
east coast lighthouse,

208
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,829
and I'm coming home to share
it with my beautiful wife.

209
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,600
- Okay.
- Wait really?

210
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,930
- Yes.
- Yes!

211
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:52,829
See you in 10 minutes!

212
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,229
Hey!

213
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,099
I'm going to make
love to my wife!

214
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,030
Lookin' good.

215
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,530
- Slow down!
- My man!

216
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,060
Aw, geez, Rick. I don't know
if I like this plan, you know?

217
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,900
I mean, crowds, they have a
tendency to make me really nervous.

218
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,900
Morty, relax.

219
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,770
It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s
out there.

220
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,830
You're gonna be fine.

221
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,200
Just follow my lead.

222
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,770
Yo, deejay, drop that beat.

223
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,730
Uh-oh, Morty.

224
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,430
This crowd looks too small for
one of our famous rap concerts.

225
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,769
I don't think we can
perform our new song,

226
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,430
"the recipe for
concentrated dark matter",

227
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,669
for a crowd this tiny.

228
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:29,129
You got that right, Rick.

229
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,199
Now that's more like it!

230
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,769
Morty, here we go.

231
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,830
Let me hear everybody say
"hey-oh!" Yeah!

232
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,899
All the ladies say, "yeah!"

233
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,400
Everybody over 30, do this with
your hands!

234
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,669
Everybody with a red shirt,
jump up and down!

235
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,570
Yeah, don't move.

236
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,200
Yo, everyone whose
first name begins with an "L"

237
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,970
who isn't hispanic, walk in a
circle the same number of times

238
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,470
as the square root of your age
times 10!

239
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,230
Run, Morty!

240
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,169
Before the system reboots!

241
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,930
Yeah! You like that?

242
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,129
Now who's unremarkable?

243
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:25,399
You hungry for apples?

244
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,299
Are you hungry...
for... apples?!

245
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,130
Oh, my God.

246
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:40,029
That's the best sex I've ever
had in my life.

247
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:43,729
It's... it's... too good.

248
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,070
I don't deserve this, Beth.

249
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm a fraud.

250
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,800
Oh, man, Rick!

251
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,970
Where we running to?

252
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,470
Out of the simulation, Morty.

253
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,830
Normally, the chamber operates
like a treadmill,

254
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,129
with the virtual world disappearing
behind us and being

255
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:58,970
rendered in front of us as we move
through it, but while it's frozen, Morty,

256
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,630
we can get to...

257
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:01,899
The edge.

258
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,870
Here we go.

259
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:04,100
Holy crap!

260
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,129
Come on, Morty.

261
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,870
Sir, they're over the edge.

262
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:10,199
Yes, they are.

263
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,070
Just... as... planned.

264
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:18,429
Oh, this is going
to be such a mind-

265
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:23,728
Keep your eyes peeled for the
central processing room, Morty.

266
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,600
That's how we're gonna scam
these idiots.

267
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,030
So, hey, why do these
aliens keep coming after you, Rick,

268
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,300
if you're so much
smarter than them?

269
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,200
It's an obsession for
them at this point.

270
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,500
The zigerions have been trying
to outsmart me for years, Morty.

271
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,269
Every time they do, I'm one step
ahead of them.

272
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:38,769
Aha!
Here we go.

273
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,799
Grab as many processors as you
can carry, Morty.

274
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,200
These guys aren't good at much,

275
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,570
but they're really good
at making these chips.

276
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,690
I've got so many, I can
barely hold them all.

277
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,470
Look at look at this.

278
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,629
Oops. I dropped one.

279
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,170
Don't worry about it, Morty.

280
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,910
There's plenty of them,
you little goofball.

281
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,570
Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!

282
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,629
Come on, quit it, Rick!

283
00:10:58,649 --> 00:10:59,600
Quit it!

284
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,877
Nothing wrong with
just a little bit of horseplay

285
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:03,514
every now and
then, little fella.

286
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:16,370
Wow. What do you know?

287
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:17,629
Huh. That was easy.

288
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:20,299
Totes malotes, dawg.

289
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,799
Just kind of hard to
believe, you know?

290
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,830
Believe it, Morty.

291
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,799
And once again, I'm flying away
with everything I can carry,

292
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,300
and the zigerions got
nothing of mine.

293
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,599
Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a...
minute to talk?

294
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,769
Yes.

295
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:39,569
Look, I'm a fraud.

296
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,870
I mean, let's face it,

297
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,529
"hungry for apples" is just a
rip-off of "got milk?"

298
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:44,729
It's almost identical.

299
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,269
- Yes.
- Okay.

300
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,969
I deserve that.

301
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,299
Umm... I guess... I'll just pack
up my desk.

302
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,370
Yes.

303
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,269
Oh, my God.

304
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,730
Wait. You know what?! No!

305
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,500
The milk people don't have a patent
on simple rhetorical questions!

306
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,000
There's not even a single word

307
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,700
in "hungry for apples" that's
shared by "got milk?".

308
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,769
It's a completely
different slogan.

309
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,529
It's different!

310
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,299
And I shouldn't be fired.

311
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,299
- I should be promoted!
- Yes.

312
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,730
Yeah!

313
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,600
Wait. Really?

314
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,299
- Yes.
- Yes!

315
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,100
I mean, I'm it may be derivative,

316
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,800
but it's the most
successful campaign to come out

317
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,899
- of this agency in a long time.
- Yes.

318
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,500
I'm not saying it
should win an award for commercials,

319
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:31,570
but it could certainly be nominated
for an award for commercials

320
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:34,030
specifically about apples,
like... an appley or something.

321
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,700
Yes.

322
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,229
Is there really an award called the
appley for apple-related ad campaigns?

323
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,029
Yes.

324
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,570
- Could we nominate me?
- Yes.

325
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,430
Holy crap!

326
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,970
Get in, Morty.

327
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,500
I'm gonna be able to
use these processors

328
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,430
to make some real
important science stuff.

329
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:56,899
Huh.

330
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,500
I thought I entered
the code right.

331
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,730
Wha well, what's this?

332
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,799
What could this possibly be?

333
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,899
Because it looks like you're
inside a simulation...

334
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,399
Inside a simulation.

335
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:18,029
You're still on the ship.

336
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:19,529
Game-day bucket go boom.

337
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:22,499
Sir, the, uh, doctor's
appointment to examine

338
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,500
the discoloration on
your butthole flaps was-

339
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,899
Too loud, Cynthia.
Too loud and too specific.

340
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:33,700
We've known how to make concentrated
dark matter for a long time.

341
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,970
But now we also know the code to
your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez!

342
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,930
All your most valuable secrets
will now be ours!

343
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,370
Uh, yeah, until I
get home before you,

344
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,699
and change the combination,
you bunch of idiots!

345
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,129
That is why you're never
getting home.

346
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:49,269
Get them!

347
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,730
Run, Morty!

348
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,500
Oh, my God!

349
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,299
Ow!

350
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,570
I got to tell you, this morning,

351
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,600
I didn't even know
this award existed.

352
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,429
Now I'm holding one.

353
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,000
And... um...

354
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,529
Look, I want to say that today
was the best day of my life...

355
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,529
But... the truth is, it's
more meaningful than that.

356
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:45,699
<i>My man!</i>

357
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,800
Yes. Thank you, sir.

358
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:53,169
I... am... finally complete!

359
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,129
<i>My my my my man!</i>

360
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,329
What the hell?!

361
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:07,800
No.

362
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,529
- Jerry?!
- Dad!

363
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:10,899
What are you doing here?

364
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,600
Why are you dressed
like a waiter?

365
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,399
Screw it. We don't have time.

366
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:16,200
- Come on.
- No!

367
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:24,229
Ohhhhh!

368
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,429
Aah!

369
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:50,100
Yes! Yes! Yes!

370
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,029
Oof!

371
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,769
Man up, Jerry!

372
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:04,290
I may need you to
work the lasers.

373
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,330
Oh, man!

374
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,700
They're hot on our tail, Rick!

375
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,730
I guess they really do
have concentrated dark matter.

376
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,330
Well, you know how to
make it, too, right, Rick?

377
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,600
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,769
Uh, check the engine room.

379
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:27,470
We just need cesium, plutonic
quarks, and bottled water.

380
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,700
It's all here, Rick!

381
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,529
Wow, Morty.

382
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:32,129
Lucky break.

383
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:33,299
Grab that bucket.

384
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,570
Okay, two parts plutonic quarks,
one part cesium.

385
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,270
Okay. Uh-huh.

386
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:40,829
All right.

387
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,799
Now empty the water
bottle into the bucket

388
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:45,858
and pour it all into the fuel tank
so we can get the hell out of here!

389
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,929
What are you doing, Morty?!

390
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:47,930
There's no time!

391
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,030
Oh, no.

392
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,029
What the-

393
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:57,899
No!

394
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,970
Oh, my God, Rick.

395
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,170
How dumb are you?

396
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,130
You're inside a simulation...

397
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,930
Of a simulation...

398
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,370
Inside another giant simulation!

399
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,700
We never had the recipe for
concentrated dark matter.

400
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,200
But we do now!

401
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,600
We do now, sucka!

402
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,370
You simulated my
grandson's genitalia?!

403
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,970
You bunch of diabolical sons
of bitches!

404
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,069
Kevin fought real hard to
supervise that project.

405
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,900
You said you weren't gonna
tell anyone!

406
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,200
I'm never gonna live this down,
am I?

407
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,299
All right. Okay.

408
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,369
All right, great. Wonderful.

409
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,170
You win. Can we go home now?

410
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,600
I don't know. Can you?

411
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:39,099
Ha! Nice.

412
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,699
Okay, okay.

413
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,569
Show this gullible
turd to his shuttle.

414
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:43,869
I'm done with him.

415
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,130
Oh, wait. Let me get a picture.

416
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,029
Aww. Look at his face.

417
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:49,130
He's trying to figure out if
he's in a simulation still.

418
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,300
Are you, Rick?

419
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,730
Are you?

420
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,170
You're not.

421
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,999
Or are you?

422
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:01,269
Oh, and, by the way, I don't
have discolored butthole flaps.

423
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,569
That was part of the simulation.

424
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:03,299
Oh.

425
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,930
Uh, sir, should I cancel that
appointment, then?

426
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,331
Yeah! Of course you should!

427
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,930
No, keep it.

428
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,599
Move it up, actually,
if you can.

429
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:16,830
Hey, Jerry, don't worry
about it.

430
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:19,130
So what if the most meaningful
day of your life was...

431
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,129
a simulation operating
at minimum capacity?

432
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,500
You know what, Rick?

433
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,299
Those guys took you
for a ride, too.

434
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,299
You should try having a little respect

435
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,100
for the dummies of the universe,
now that you're one of us.

436
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,799
Maybe you're right, Jerry.

437
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,769
Maybe you're right.

438
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,230
All right, everybody.

439
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,099
Two parts plutonic quarks...

440
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,669
One part cesium...

441
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,769
And listen, I'm sorry for
yelling earlier.

442
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,000
I couldn't ask for
a better staff.

443
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:51,270
I love you guys, and I love all
your families.

444
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:53,569
And the final ingredient...

445
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,230
Whoa!

446
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,430
What the hell?!

447
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,470
What happened back there?

448
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,900
Why don't you ask the smartest
people in the universe, Jerry?

449
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,269
Oh, yeah. You can't.

450
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:05,970
They blew up.

451
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,529
So...
What do you think?

452
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,900
You're fired.

453
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,070
Wha-

454
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,200
But this idea was tested in a
state-of-the-art simulation.

455
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,000
Well, then, it was a
terrible simulation.

456
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,469
Get out.

457
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:05,629
Man, how does a guy like that go
home and have sex with his wife?

458
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,930
Hey, Morty.

459
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,870
What?

460
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,030
Hey, little buddy.

461
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,130
How you doing in here right now?

462
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,970
Aw, geez, Rick.

463
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,029
What are you doing, man?

464
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:14,269
You're a good kid, Morty.

465
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:15,930
You're a real little
character, Morty.

466
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,900
Oh, boy.

467
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,960
You know, I had a really
rocky road today, Morty.

468
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,419
You're my little
friend, aren't you?

469
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,129
We had some good times
together, Morty?

470
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,691
You're a real true
hero out in the field.

471
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,191
You're a real trouper,
huh, Morty?

472
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,130
Have you been drinking, Rick?

473
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,929
I really appreciate you, Morty.

474
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,870
Okay, cool.

475
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,130
All right, Rick you
little son of a bitch!

476
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,100
Are you a simulation?!

477
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,069
Huh?! Are you a simulation?!

478
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:41,129
No! No! No!

479
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,730
You little son of a bitch!

480
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,269
I'm sorry, Morty.

481
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:46,809
You're a good
you're a good kid, Morty.

482
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:47,470
Geez!

483
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,029
You're a good
you're a good kid.

484
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:49,869
Oh, my God!

485
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,569
