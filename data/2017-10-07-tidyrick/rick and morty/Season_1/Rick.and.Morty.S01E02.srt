<i>Coin collecting is considered
the perfect hobby.</i>

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,840
What?
Why are you looking at me?

7
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,645
You want to go outside?
Outside?

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,969
Outside?

9
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:09,745
Are you kidding me?!

10
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,475
- Come on!
- Oh, my God.

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,845
- What's wrong?
- Your idiot dog!

12
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,545
Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad.
Did you, snuffles?

13
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,615
You're a good boy.

14
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,514
Don't praise him now, Morty!
He just peed on the carpet!

15
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:20,575
Bad dog! Bad!

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,300
Morty, come on.
I need your help tonight.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,145
Hey, wait, hold on
a second, Rick.

18
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:26,749
You wouldn't by any chance have
some sort of crazy science thing

19
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,475
you could whip up that
might help make this dog

20
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:30,166
a little smarter, would you?

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,915
I thought the whole point of having
a dog was to feel superior, Jerry.

22
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,344
If I were you, I wouldn't pull
that thread.

23
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,069
Come on, Morty.

24
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,045
Listen, Rick,
if you're gonna stay here rent-free

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,815
and use my son for
your stupid science,

26
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,945
the least you could do is put a little
bit of it to use for the family.

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,951
You make that dog smart or...
Morty's grounded!

28
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,275
- Ha-ha!
- Aw, man!

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,045
Boy, you really got me up against
a wall this time, Jerry.

30
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,575
All right, ruffles...
What's his name?

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,245
Snuffles.

32
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,415
Snuffles, shake.

33
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,445
Roll over.

34
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,945
Go to the bathroom.

35
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,344
- Holy crap!
- No way.

36
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:11,315
Yeah, you're at the top
of your game now, Jerry.

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,215
Have fun.
Come on, Morty.

38
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,945
- That was fantastic, Rick!
- Yeah, Morty, if you like that,

39
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,020
boy, you're you're really going
to flip your lid over this one.

40
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,045
W-w-w-what is it?

41
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,375
It's a device, Morty,
that when you put it in your ear,

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,275
you can enter people's
dreams, Morty.

43
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,291
It's just like that movie that
you keep crowing about.

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,115
- You talking about "Inception"?
- That's right, Morty.

45
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,175
This is gonna be
a lot like that,

46
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,330
except, you know, it's
gonna maybe make sense.

47
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,715
"Inception" made sense.

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,344
You don't have to try
to impress me, Morty.

49
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:37,275
Listen, tonight we're gonna go
into the home of your math teacher,

50
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,814
Mr. Goldenfold, and
we're gonna incept the idea

51
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:42,015
in his brain to give you
A's in math, Morty.

52
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,245
That way you can, you know,

53
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,000
y-you're gonna help me with my
science, Morty, all the time.

54
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,045
Geez, Rick, in the

55
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,145
time it took you to make this

56
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,175
thing, couldn't you have just,

57
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,874
you know, helped me with my
homework?

58
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:52,300
Are you listening to me, Morty?

59
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,245
Homework is stupid.

60
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,944
The whole point is
to get less of it.

61
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,145
Come on, let's just get
over there and deal with this thing.

62
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,944
W-we're gonna incept your
teacher.

63
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,745
You're frustrating me.

64
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,715
<i>You don't know me!</i>

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,944
<i>Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice.</i>

66
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:13,981
<i>Next week on "The days and
nights of Mrs. Pancakes"...</i>

67
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,314
<i>You don't know me!</i>

68
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,675
<i>Then let me get to know yo,
damn it!</i>

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,374
Uh-oh! Spoilers!

70
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:21,745
I'm a full season behind.

71
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,914
Wow, Rick, I can't
believe we're sitting around,

72
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,715
standing around in
Mr. Goldenfold's house.

73
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,860
It's really weird.

74
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:29,545
It's about to get a
whole lot weirder, Morty.

75
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,745
Wheat thins. Wheat thins.

76
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,015
I'll take two.

77
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,075
Oh, I think you've had
enough, sir.

78
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,615
You don't know me.

79
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:47,780
All right, Morty,
time to make our move.

80
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,775
Make it bounce.

81
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,814
No, you didn't.

82
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,045
Oh, jiggle it now.

83
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,414
You better stop with that.

84
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:55,115
Allahu akbar!

85
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,760
We're gonna take
control of this plane!

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,474
We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith
gets better grades in math!

87
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,115
Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!

88
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,200
The name's not buddy.

89
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,914
It's Goldenfold.

90
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,944
Nice to wheat you!

91
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,314
Take cover, Morty!

92
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,115
Ooh!

93
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,360
Goldenfold's got more
control here than I anticipated.

94
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,001
I mean, the guy teaches
high-school math.

95
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:19,814
I didn't take him for an
active dreamer.

96
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,844
We got to take him out so he
wakes up, Morty.

97
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:22,944
But we can't get killed.

98
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:25,780
If you get killed in someone else's
dream, you die for real, Morty.

99
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,075
What?!
Are you kidding me?!

100
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,445
Ohhhhhh!

101
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,775
Don't be a baby!

102
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,974
You avoid getting shot in real
life all the time, Morty.

103
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,974
Just do the same thing here, and
we'll be fine!

104
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,844
Now bring me my slippers.

105
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:39,275
Now, be my footstool, snuffles.

106
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,174
This is what I'm talking about.

107
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,145
- This is a dog.
- Oh, yeah.

108
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,510
This should play out just fine.

109
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,815
You said the same thing,
equally sarcastically,

110
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,839
at our wedding and guess what.

111
00:04:59,039 --> 00:04:59,875
Oh, my God.

112
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:01,275
He's trying to tell us
something.

113
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,715
That is so awesome.

114
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,745
Aw, he's saying
"I love lasagna".

115
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,445
He's saying "I love Obama".

116
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:15,075
So cute!

117
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,801
I'm posting this online, like,
right now.

118
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,775
I should call Bob Saget.

119
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,974
Is that still a thing?

120
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,570
Hmm?

121
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,169
Goldenfold, we're coming out!

122
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,245
We just want to talk!

123
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,875
Why would I negotiate with you?

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,614
Because we're both rational adults

125
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,474
that don't want
anything bad to happen.

126
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:48,169
And because I have a human shield.

127
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,544
Mrs. Pancakes!

128
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,575
Oh, no, Morty.

129
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,900
His subconscious is panicking.

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,844
Run!

131
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,515
Relax, Morty.

132
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,215
Look!

133
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,044
Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute.

134
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,044
Come on!

135
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,914
Hey, you don't know me!

136
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,145
Oh, no, Rick, look!

137
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,730
Goldenfold landed the plane,
and he's created a mechanical

138
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,445
arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out
of the air while he lets us fall

139
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,044
- into a giant vat of lava!
- Pretty concise, Morty.

140
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:22,145
Looks like we've merely
prolonged the inevitable.

141
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,215
That's it, Morty!

142
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,380
Prolonging the inevitable!

143
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,514
Listen, if we go into
Mrs. Pancakes' dream,

144
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,375
everything will go 100
times slower, Morty.

145
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,120
That'll buy us some time to
figure this out!

146
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,244
You don't know m-

147
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:34,844
All right, let's go.

148
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,614
Oh, man, Rick, this is
pretty weird.

149
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:44,745
Don't judge, Morty.

150
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,259
Okay.
All right, well...

151
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,275
Look, Mrs. Pancakes is
right over there.

152
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,521
I'll just go ask her to tell

153
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:52,474
goldenfold not to kill us when
she wakes up.

154
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:55,191
Whoa, whoa, Morty, the
trick to incepting is making

155
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,044
people think they came up with
the idea.

156
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:58,114
Listen to me.

157
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:01,275
If we're gonna incept
Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend.

158
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,560
I'll talk to you after lunch.

159
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:05,815
Ooh, hey!

160
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:07,469
Ooh, oh!

161
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,344
Oh, man.

162
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,445
Come and join us.

163
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,715
I'm sorry. No, no.

164
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,344
- Ooh, come here!
- No, thanks!

165
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:13,215
Ooh, wow!

166
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,315
- Come over here, baby!
- No, I'm okay.

167
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,940
Whoa!

168
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,945
Summer?!

169
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,114
Hey, there, stranger.

170
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,645
What do you think
of these things?

171
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,245
Ohh! Oh! Gross!
Gross!

172
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,515
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

173
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,044
What's the matter with you,
Morty?

174
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:29,015
Calm down!

175
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,445
You're kind of killing the vibe
in here.

176
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,344
It's Summer!

177
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:32,974
Aw, geez.

178
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,174
Looks like goldenfold has some

179
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:35,420
predilections so shameful he

180
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,819
buries them in the dreams of the

181
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,114
people in his dreams,
including a pervy attraction

182
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,145
to your underage sister.

183
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,344
Can you blame him?

184
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,215
Come on, old man, little boy.

185
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,075
Let's make an inter-generational
sandwich.

186
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,174
Oh, my God.

187
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,414
Oh, my God!

188
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:49,275
Put some clothes on, for Pete's
sake!

189
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,344
This is disgusting!

190
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:53,015
- I'm gonna puke!
- I can't take it, Rick!

191
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,174
Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure
chamber are punishable by death!

192
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:58,344
Off with their heads!

193
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:00,060
Time to go another
dream deep, Morty!

194
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,075
What the hell?

195
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,474
Why would Mr. goldenfold's dream
version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream

196
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,575
version of a centaur be dreaming
about a scary place like this, Rick?

197
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,375
Geez, I don't know, Morty.

198
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,660
Wha-what do you want from me?

199
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:23,375
Welcome to your
nightmare, bitch!

200
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,674
- Oh, here we go!
- Holy crap!

201
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,245
Looks like some sort of

202
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,491
legally safe knock-off of an

203
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:30,044
'80s horror character with

204
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:32,114
miniature swords for fingers
instead of knives.

205
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,645
I'm scary Terry.

206
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,169
You can run, but you
can't hide, bitch!

207
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,745
Whoa! Hey, buddy.

208
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,515
What you got going on there?

209
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,815
Snuffles fix.

210
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,245
Make better.

211
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,115
Humans understand snuffles now?

212
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,975
That... is... awesome!

213
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,615
Snuffles want to be understood.

214
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,475
Snuffles need to be understood.

215
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,444
Okay, yeah.

216
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:56,890
I get what Beth was
talking about.

217
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,645
Fun's over.

218
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,732
Whoa, dad, you can't,
like, endow a creature

219
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:01,370
with sentience and
then rip it away.

220
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,275
- Why not?
- I don't know.

221
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,375
It's Indian giving.

222
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,745
<i>A sophisticated predator,</i>

223
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,314
<i>nature's perfect killing</i>

224
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:11,115

225
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,345

226
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,745
<i>It was only with years of</i>

227
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,515
<i>selective breeding
and genetic altering</i>

228
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,215
<i>that this noble beast

229
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,969
<i>subservient little buddy.</i>

230
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:30,515
Aw! Oh, my God!

231
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,314
He recognizes the other dogs on TV.

232
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,515
<i>"A," "b"</i>

233
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,145

234
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,345

235
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,970

00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,544
Holy crap!

237
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,745
We have to escape into
someone else's dreams, Morty!

238
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,275
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!

239
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,475
<i>"E," "f"</i>

240
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,745
he'll design your death

241
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,475
The little girl!

242
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:57,569
Huh?

243
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:00,314
"J," "k," he'll really ruin
your day

244
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,145
Are you kidding me?
This again?

245
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,414
Oh, man, it looks like we've
hit dream bedrock here, Morty.

246
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:05,444
Oh, geez, Rick.

247
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:06,845
W-w-whoa, this isn't good.

248
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,669
Nothing but fear from here on
out, bitch!

249
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,615
Ohhhh!

250
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,115
Holy crap, Morty.

251
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,544
He can travel through dreams.

252
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:16,044
He can travel through dreams!
We're so screwed!

253
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,469
Where are my testicles, Summer?

254
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,145
Where are my testicles, Summer?

255
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,150
They were removed.
Where have they gone?

256
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,115
Oh, wow.

257
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,414
That's an intense line of
questioning, snuffles.

258
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:39,645
Do not call me that!

259
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:43,174
"Snuffles" was my slave name.

260
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:47,544
You shall now call me snowball,
because my fur is pretty and white.

261
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:50,574
Okay, snowball, just
calm down, okay?

262
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:51,944
You're scaring me.

263
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,375
Scaring you?

264
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,414
Tell me, Summer, if a human was

265
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,044
born with stumpy legs, would

266
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:58,444
they breed it with another

267
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:00,515
deformed human and put their

268
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,160
children on display like the
dachshund?

269
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:02,914
Uhhh...

270
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,539
Hey.

271
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,574
Oh, wow.

272
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,215
Okay, is is is everything
okay in here?

273
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,875
Jerry, come to rub my face in
urine again?

274
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,150
No!

275
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,444
No, we were... uh, just seeing if
Summer wanted to... uh...

276
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:20,174
Go on, um, one of our
famous midnight family walks!

277
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:21,275
Yeah. Totally.

278
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,700
Let's go.

279
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:28,269
You will walk when it is time
to walk.

280
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:34,245
What are we here for again?

281
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,215
Incepting?

282
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,715
We're trying to incept
me to get an "A" in math?

283
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,375
Oh, yeah.

284
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,745
Buckle up, bitch!

285
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,174
Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot!

286
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:48,245
You can run, but you
can't hide, bitch!

287
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,314
Hold on, Morty.

288
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:50,574
Y-you know what?

289
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:52,215
He keeps saying we can run but
we can hide.

290
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,875
- I say we try hiding.
- But that's the opposite of what-

291
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,845
Yeah, well, since when are we taking
this guy's advice on anything?

292
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,875
Hey, you know what?

293
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,674
You got a really good
point there, Rick.

294
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,999
Like, if the truth was that we

295
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:03,414
could hide, it's not like he'd

296
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,544
be sharing that information with
us, you know?

297
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:07,375
I-I-I think it's a
good idea, Rick.

298
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,269
Worst-case scenario
we're back to running.

299
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,475
Wow, you know what?

300
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,775
I mean, it looks like we could
have just hid this whole time.

301
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,420
Boy, Rick, that was
some good thinking.

302
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,375
Thanks, Morty.

303
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,674
Yeah, it's nice to be on the
same page every once in a while.

304
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,875
You can run...

305
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,645
But you can't hide!

306
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,819
Oh, this is perfect, Morty.
Look at that.

307
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:34,015
He's getting sleepy.

308
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,444
Just a little bit longer before
he calls it a day.

309
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,400
That's when we make our move.

310
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:46,674
Snuffles, we didn't
mean you any harm!

311
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,275
This is a huge misunderstanding.

312
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,544
Dad, he wants to be
called snowball.

313
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,645
Well, I'm not calling him that.
That's ridiculous.

314
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,715
You're being very aggressive,
Jerry.

315
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,515
Perhaps tomorrow Dr. scraps will solve
that problem with a bit of surgery.

316
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,068
You think you can control me
with a haircut?

317
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,250
Hi, honey. You're home early.

318
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,375
- How was your day?
- I don't want to talk about it!

319
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,544
Oh, of course.

320
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,029
- You never want to talk about it.
- Get off my back, bitch!

321
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:23,444
Out there. Not in here.

322
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,074
Yeah, I know, I know.

323
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:29,775
I shouldn't take my anger out
on you or scary Brandon.

324
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,574
I love you, Melissa.

325
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:34,615
I love you, too, Terry.

326
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,975
Morty, this is perfect.

327
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,845
After a little scary coitus,

328
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,550
they should be fast asleep and
then we'll incept him.

329
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:46,645
Looks like scary Terry's
having a nightmare.

330
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,845
Oh, boy, Rick.

331
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,211
I can only imagine what horrible
things must, you know...

332
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,544
...scare scary Terry.

333
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:57,674
Oh, no!
I'm late to class, bitch!

334
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:00,140
Oh, no!
I'm not wearing any pants!

335
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,975
Ah, well, Mr. Terry,

336
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,515
why don't you tell the whole class
the proper wordplay to use when

337
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,044
one is chasing one's victim
through a pumpkin patch?

338
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:12,400
Oh... um...

339
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,074
"Bitch."

340
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,745
Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think
of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch?

341
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,944
Hey, leave him alone!

342
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,814
Yeah, this is a bunch
of bullcrap.

343
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:25,780
Who cares what stupid pun you
make when you kill someone?

344
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,780
Why don't you let the poor guy
say whatever he wants?

345
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,145
Well, I never!

346
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,145
I-I see no reason to stand here
and take this.

347
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,544
You're putting too much pressure
on yourself, scary Terry.

348
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:38,414
You know, I mean, y-you're
perfectly scary enough as it is.

349
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:39,674
Hey, yo, scary T.,

350
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,414
don't even trip about your
pants... dawg.

351
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:43,615
Here's a pair on us, fool.

352
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,574
Aww, bitch.

353
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:45,845
I don't know what to say.

354
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,699
You don't need to say anything.

355
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,775
We got you, dawg.

356
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,845
You're our boy, dawg.

357
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,538
Don't even trip.

358
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,314
Oh, hey, it's you guys!

359
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,475
I haven't seen him this
relaxed in years.

360
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,944
If you guys ever need
anything, just say the word.

361
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:11,164
As a matter of fact, Terry, there is
something you could help us with.

362
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:13,645
"Q," "r," you won't get very far

363
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,745
I always hated that song!

364
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:22,715
These halves don't belong
together, bitch!

365
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,400
Sex is sacred!

366
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,875
This is because you don't give
Morty Smith good grades, bitch!

367
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,914
Holy crap! God damn!

368
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,745
I know one thing for sure...

369
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,814
I'm giving Morty an "A" in math,
and that's my idea.

370
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:50,899
That is an original thought.

371
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,944
What the hell?

372
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:00,544
Out of the frying pan
dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?

373
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:01,975
Oh, man, what's going on?

374
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,674
Well, it's possible
that your dog became self-aware

375
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,319
and made modifications on the
cognition amplifier, then turned

376
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,715
on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after

377
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,444
learning about humanity's cruel
subjugation of his species,

378
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:14,174
but your guess is as
good as mine, Morty.

379
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:17,615
I can't believe how mean snuffles
got just because he's smart.

380
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,044
This is why I choose to get C's.

381
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:20,840
Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.

382
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,814
- Dad!
- Rick!

383
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,399
- Oh, thank God, Morty.
- Oh, you're welcome.

384
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,044
All right, let's get
out of here.

385
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:30,515
If we hurry we can set
up camp in a sewer tunnel

386
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,600
or something before the dogs
completely take over.

387
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:33,615
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

388
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,740
We're not going anywhere.

389
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,944
This is my house.
I'm not abandoning it.

390
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:38,275
It's all over, Jerry.

391
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,645
The dogs are on a path to total
world domination.

392
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,269
But, hey, at least they know not
to piss on your carpet, right?

393
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,845
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.

394
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,169
Gentlemen, a moment
of your time.

395
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:52,944
See that?

396
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:54,975
I'm peeing all over
your special guns.

397
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,444
That means I own them.

398
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,944
Bad person. Bad.

399
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:03,115
Ooh, great plan, Jerry.

400
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,698
Bring the boy to me.

401
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:09,475
You were always kind to me,

402
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,615
Morty.

403
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,174
That's why I will leave you with
your testicles.

404
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:17,015
From now on, you will be my best
friend and live by my side.

405
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,415
Th-thanks, snuffles.

406
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,675
Begin phase two.

407
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,114
<i>Fighting continues as the dog army
captures the eastern seaboard.</i>

408
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:29,715
<i>It appears clear at this time...</i>

409
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,644
<i>that the era of human superiority
has come to a bitter end.</i>

410
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,144
Please! Please don't kill me!

411
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,745
What's she saying, bill?

412
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,438
I think she's saying,
"I love lasagna."

413
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,800
Mmm.

414
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,745
Thank you, Fido.

415
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,874
Rick!

416
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,975
I thought you were dead!

417
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,614
No, no, no, I was just
playing dead.

418
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:11,739
Good news, though, Morty.

419
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,975
This whole thing's gonna be over
really soon.

420
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,945
- What?
- It's a dream, Morty.

421
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,245
We're in your dog's dream.

422
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,215
The night the dogs captured us,
after you cried and crapped your pants,

423
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,914
we all went to sleep.

424
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:23,948
Then I used my dream inceptors to put
the two of us inside snuffles' dream.

425
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,044
But I-it's been like a
whole year!

426
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:27,314
It's been six hours.

427
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,015
Dreams move one one-hundredth
the speed of reality, and dog time

428
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,245
is one-seventh human time.

429
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,344
So, you know, every day here is
like a minute.

430
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:36,129
It's like "Inception," Morty,
so if it's confusing and stupid,

431
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:37,644
then so is everyone's
favorite movie.

432
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:40,715
Aw, man.
I really liked this life.

433
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,644
Well, at least I didn't really
crap my pants.

434
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:45,044
No, no, that happened
before you went to sleep, Morty.

435
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:46,814
You're sleeping in your crap
right now.

436
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:47,979
Out of all the things that

437
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,260
happened to you, that was the

438
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,074
only real thing that, you know,
is that you crapped your pants.

439
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,814
I mean, it's a mess out there.

440
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:55,314
I got some on my hands, Morty,

441
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:56,775
and then I got it on the dream

442
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,275
inceptor, and a piece fell in my
mouth.

443
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,175
Aw, man, geez!
Seriously?

444
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,314
Look, d-d-d-don't worry
about it, Morty.

445
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,040
Here, here take these, Morty.
Take these.

446
00:19:04,864 --> 00:19:06,970
Are these pills supposed to wake
me up, or something?

447
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,844
Close.

448
00:19:07,969 --> 00:19:09,569
It's gonna make your kidneys
shut down.

449
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,275
What?!

450
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,314
It's necessary for the
plan, Morty.

451
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:14,574
Don't even trip, dawg.

452
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,275
It's pretty bad,
emperor snowball.

453
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,445
We're gonna need to
do another operation.

454
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,044
Anything.
Anything for my precious Morty.

455
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:24,775
Sir, as your accountant,
I must advise you that these

456
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,745
medical expenses are putting you
in serious financial jeopardy.

457
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,245
You could lose your kingdom.

458
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,945
To hell with my kingdom,
bean counter.

459
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,415
I would trade it all for my
human's health and happiness.

460
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,715
Do you think they would have
done this for us?

461
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,215
We are not them!

462
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,998
We are not... them.

463
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:53,144
Assemble the troops.

464
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,515
I've made a decision.

465
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,245
Taking over the human's world

466
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,745
will lead to nothing but more
heartbreak, more cruelty.

467
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,374
Instead, we will go to a new
world and colonize it with

468
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:08,874
a society of intelligent dogs,
one that will not make the same

469
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,975
mistakes as humanity and one where
pet insurance will be mandatory.

470
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,374
I'm gonna miss you, snowball.

471
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:16,915
You can call me snuffles,

472
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,698
Morty, and I'm going to miss
you, too, very much.

473
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,915
Jerry?

474
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,044
I'm sorry.

475
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:34,544
It's just like the end of
"Old Yeller."

476
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:36,475
Oh, Jerry.

477
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,175
You mean because
it had dogs in it.

478
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,314
Wow!

479
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,245
A whole world populated
by intelligent dogs.

480
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,844
I wonder what it'll
be like, Rick.

481
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:45,445
I think it will be great, Morty.

482
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,844
You know...
it could be developed in-into

483
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:50,144
a very satisfying project for
people of all ages.

484
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:52,775
I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for
at least 11 minutes a pop.

485
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,844
You know, may-maybe they'll do
it board-driven.

486
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:57,250
You know, that's a
real comforting idea, Rick.

487
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,614
What do you know, Morty?

488
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:01,089
What do you know?

489
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,515
Hi, guys. I'm your new
teacher for scary class.

490
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,475
My name is
scary Mr. Johnson.

491
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,491
Uh, actually, you know what?

492
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,874
That's my dad's name, so

493
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,874
why don't you just call me
scary Glenn, yeah?

494
00:21:43,314 --> 00:21:45,115
So, anyway, I understand
your previous teacher

495
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,245
was having you work on
fundamentals of fear.

496
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,415
Which is what is that?

497
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,844
You know?

498
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:52,314
So, uh, here here's what I say...

499
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:56,644
you can't learn anything
until you learn... how to chill.

500
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:58,869
Oooh!

501
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:03,438
This is how you dream, bitch.

502
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:08,463
