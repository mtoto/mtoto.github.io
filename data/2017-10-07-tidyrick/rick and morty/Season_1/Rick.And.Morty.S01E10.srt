1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,205
- So, dad, guess what tomorrow is.
- Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.

2
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:06,306
No.

3
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:08,042
- Well, it... might be.
- It is.

4
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:12,912
Fine. But also, tomorrow is your
one-year anniversary back in our lives.

5
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:15,114
I'm gonna make you
flying-saucer-shaped pancakes.

6
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,830
Oh, t-t-there's no
need to do that, Beth.

7
00:00:16,855 --> 00:00:18,477
Regular pancakes are fine.

8
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:24,524
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:26,826
Oh, what is happening?!

10

11
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:02,897
- Happy anniversary, dad.
- Oh, I get it.

12
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:06,398
Regular pancakes are already
shaped like flying saucers.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,597
I-I should be making <i>you</i> breakfast
for putting up with <i>me</i>.

14
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,214
<i>You</i> should be making
us a whole restaurant.

15
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,040
Nonsense. We couldn't be
happier to have you around.

16
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:15,975
I just wish I got
to see more of you.

17
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:20,447
Rick Sanchez of earth
dimension C-137,

18
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:21,981
you are under arrest
for crimes against

19
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:23,445
alternate Ricks by the authority

20
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,152
of the trans-dimensional
council of Ricks.

21
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:28,186
- Hey! What the heck?!
- Neutralize the Jerry.

22
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,122
Wait! No! I'll --

23
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:29,856
Dad!

24
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:31,357
- Dad!
- Rick!

25
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,492
Everybody, relax.

26
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:34,828
If I know these a-holes,
and I am these a-holes,

27
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,262
they just want to haul
me to their stupid

28
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:38,498
clubhouse and waste my time with
a bunch of questions.

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,499
Let's get it over with.

30
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:40,467
Bring his Morty.

31
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:42,936
- Oh, man.
- Leave my Morty out of this.

32
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:45,371
You lost the right to have a
say in these things when you

33
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:46,940
refused to j-- join the
council.

34
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:48,341
W-w-w-what about Jerry?

35
00:01:48,343 --> 00:01:51,278
Will you at least
unfreeze my daughter's idiot?

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
...Give you anything!

37
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:55,482
I have a rare antique-coin
collection!

38
00:01:55,484 --> 00:01:56,950
Just don't hurt me!

39
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,089
Okay, maybe not antique,
but it was a limited minting.

40
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:04,090
They have little R2-D2s instead
of George Washington.

41
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:07,560
- Our son's been abducted!
- You hate me for buying those coins!

42
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:13,867
- Geez, Rick, w-what is this place?
- The citadel of Ricks.

43
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:16,936
It's the secret headquarters for
the council of Ricks.

44
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:18,304
Council of Ricks?

45
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:20,206
As you know, Morty, I've
got a lot of enemies

46
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,376
in the universe that consider
my genius a threat --

47
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:25,177
galactic terrorists,
a few sub-galactic dictators,

48
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,012
most of the entire intergalactic
government.

49
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,882
Wherever you find people
with heads up their asses,

50
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:30,350
someone wants a piece
of your grandpa,

51
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:33,052
and a lot of versions
of me on different timelines had

52
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:35,889
the same problem, so a few
thousand versions of me had the

53
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:38,758
ingenious idea of
banding together

54
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,860
like a herd of cattle or a
school of fish or those

55
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:43,295
people who answer questions on
yahoo! Answers.

56
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,631
Hey! What do you know?
It's a cowboy version of me.

57
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,100
Geez, you're easy to impress.

58
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:49,836
Yeah, most timelines have a Rick,
and most Ricks have a Morty.

59
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:52,372
This place is a real who's who
of who's you and me.

60
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:56,576
Turn your boring, old Morty
into a-- hot fashion statement

61
00:02:56,578 --> 00:02:58,077
with some Morty dazzlers.

62
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,679
Hey, check this out.

63
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:00,680
<i>Show me the Morty.</i>

64
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:01,447
Dumb.

65
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,416
Excuse me, sir,
is your Morty insured?

66
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:05,785
You know, every year,
hundreds of Mortys are injured --

67
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:06,719
Back off!

68
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:08,087
Not my cup of tea, this place.

69
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:10,590
I say the point of being a Rick
is being a Rick.

70
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:14,505
Save your anti-Rick speech for the
council of Ricks, terror-Rick.

71
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,764
Hey, save your Rick rules for the
sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig.

72
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:19,732
- [beep] me, pal.
- [beep] <i>you</i>?

73
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:22,135
No, no, no, no, no.
[beep] <i>me</i>.

74
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:36,111
Bring up the holograms.

75
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:41,254
27 Ricks brutally murdered in
their own timelines--

76
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:44,457
an unprecedented Rick-icidal
epidemic.

77
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,426
What say you, earth Rick C-137?

78
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:48,728
You think I did this?

79
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,631
Why am I the first Rick you pull in
every time a Rick stubs his toe?

80
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:55,397
You have a history of
non-cooperation with the council.

81
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,800
Yeah, so does the scientist
formerly known as Rick.

82
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,806
W-w-w-w-w-why isn't
<i>he</i> here in handcuffs?

83
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:02,375
Because <i>he's</i> dead, too!

84
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:04,811
Who else would you
have us question?

85
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:05,979
You fit the profile.

86
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:08,615
Of all the Ricks in the central
finite curve,

87
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:11,317
you're the malcontent,
the rogue.

88
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,218
I'm the Rick,

89
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,554
and so were the rest of you before
you formed this stupid alliance.

90
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,056
You wanted to be safe
from the government,

91
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:18,758
so you became a
stupid government.

92
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,793
That makes every Rick here less
Rick than me.

93
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,796
Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags.

94
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:24,964
Now, if you'll excuse me,

95
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:27,000
I've got pancakes back home with
syrup on top of them.

96
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:29,002
They're about to hit that
critical point of syrup

97
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:31,671
absorption that turns the cakes
into a gross paste,

98
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:32,872
and I hate to get all
Andy Rooney about it,

99
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:36,175
but I think we all like Fluffy
disks of cake with syrup on top,

100
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:40,179
and I think we also like to be accused
of crimes when there's evidence!

101
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:42,949
So, as they say in Canada,
peace oot!

102
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,151
Evidence! Good idea.

103
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:46,919
Scan his portal gun!

104
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,187
Oh, come on.

105
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,456
Don't look at another man's
portal-gun history.

106
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,692
We -- we all go to weird places.

107
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:56,195
Yes, but it appears you alone
have been going to the exact

108
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:59,899
timelines and locations in which
the murders occurred.

109
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,035
What?!
That's Rick-diculous!

110
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:03,569
I'm obviously being set up.

111
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:06,039
Earth Rick C-137, the council

112
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:10,043
of Ricks sentences you to the
machine of unspeakable doom,

113
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:13,012
which swaps your conscious and
unconscious minds,

114
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:14,647
rendering your fantasies
pointless while

115
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,884
everything you've known becomes
impossible to grasp.

116
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:20,520
Also, every 10 seconds,
it stabs your balls.

117
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:22,389
I've heard enough.

118
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:26,459
Run, Morty!

119
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,760
Unh-unh. Not you.

120
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:31,664
Aaaah!

121
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:34,489
No!

122
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,921
Oh! Oh!

123
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:01,660
Yeah, I'd like to order one large
person with extra people, please.

124
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,529
White people.
No, no, no, no. Black people.

125
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,131
And hispanic on half.

126
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:20,346
Yes, I'd like to order one large
sofa chair with extra chair, please.

127
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,315
High chair.
No, no, no, no. Recliner.

128
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,283
And wheelchair on half.

129
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:38,431
They could have gone into any
one of these.

130
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:40,299
- Son of a...
- Oh, geez.

131
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:41,968
- Oh, man!
- We lost 'em.

132
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,104
Yeah, I'd like to order one large
phone with extra phones, please.

133
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,773
Cellphone.
No, no, no, no. Rotary.

134
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:48,675
And pay phone on half.

135
00:06:48,977 --> 00:06:51,778
That'll keep 'em busy for a while.

136
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,016
Those guys were wrong, right?

137
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:58,917
Y-y-y-you-- you wouldn't kill
yourself -- yourselves.

138
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,187
Of course not, Morty.
How could that profit me?

139
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:02,855
But someone out there
<i>is</i> killing Ricks,

140
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,690
and the council ain't
gonna stop thinking it's me

141
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,559
until we clear our names --
by finding the real Rick-killer.

142
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:08,728
I'm scared, Rick.

143
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,296
Maybe we should go home and
stockpile weapons,

144
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:11,898
like that show
"doomsday preppers".

145
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,332
Not really my style, Morty.

146
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:16,264
Besides, your home is most likely
swarming with Ricks by now.

147
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,463
All right, listen, Jerry.
If Rick calls,

148
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:23,208
this device is gonna
trace his location.

149
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,112
You just got to keep him on the
phone for 30 seconds or longer.

150
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:27,146
Who wants lemonade?

151
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:28,614
Oh, yeah.

152
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:31,517
Mmm!
Oh! Delicious!

153
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,019
Beth you're a treasure.

154
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:36,355
I have a Beth just like you in my
reality, except you know what?

155
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:39,225
She's not as brilliant or
attractive.

156
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:42,328
Aw.
Thank you.

157
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,263
Oh! She did! She did it!

158
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,379
H-hello?

159
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:53,339
- <i>Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.</i>
- Rick! Hey.

160
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:54,207
What's -- what's up?

161
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,242
<i>So, listen, the heat's on,
and there's nowhere left to turn,</i>

162
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:00,475
<i>so Morty and I are just gonna fly
my spaceship into a black hole.</i>

163
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:01,681
- What?!
<i>- Is that cool with you, dawg?</i>

164
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:02,515
Rick, no!

165
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:04,050
- Morty!!
- We got it.

166
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:05,384
The call's coming from...

167
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:07,386
d inside the house d

168
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:09,055
Look at his face!
You dummy!

169
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,224
Can't believe our daughter
married you.

170
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:12,258
Too easy!

171
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:16,028
The Ricks are probably gonna waste
some time messing with Jerry.

172
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,230
They won't be able to help
themselves.

173
00:08:17,232 --> 00:08:19,098
But as soon as they get bored,
they'll be onto us.

174
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,501
Phones a la clams and
phonesghetti with phone balls.

175
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,103
- Anything else?
- Yeah, more phone sticks, please.

176
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,037
Right away, sir.

177
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,740
You know, Rick, when I
first saw all those Ricks and Mortys,

178
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:30,076
I thought, "Gee, that
kind of devalues our bond".

179
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:32,945
But then I realized it just
means that our relationship must

180
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:35,814
be pretty special to span over
all those different timelines.

181
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,049
Yeah, it's <i>got</i> to be that way.

182
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:39,685
- You're a camouflage.
- Camouflage?

183
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,187
What are you talking
about, Rick?

184
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:44,357
Ricks have a very distinctive and
traceable brain wave due to our genius.

185
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,926
The best way to hide from an
enemy's radar is to stand near

186
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:49,725
someone with complementary brain
waves that make ours invisible.

187
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:52,297
See, when a Rick
is with a Morty,

188
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,869
the genius waves get
canceled out by the, uh...

189
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:58,039
...Morty waves.

190
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,508
Um... Because o-our personalities
are so different?

191
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,276
Oh, shit, dawg.

192
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,345
My portal gun was hacked
remotely, Morty--

193
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:07,379
obviously by the real
killer, to frame me.

194
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,914
But I was able to trace the
signal.

195
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,249
Come on. Let's go.

196
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:11,285
- Uh-oh.
- Excuse me.

197
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:14,320
We've tracked a pair of dangerous
criminals to this exact location.

198
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:17,089
They look exactly like us,
so in order to avoid confusion,

199
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:19,091
I'm gonna mark us each
with a red "X" right now.

200
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:21,794
That way, if someone has a gun
and we both tell you to shoot

201
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:24,797
the other one because <i>they're</i> the
evil one, you'll know who's lying.

202
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,800
Hey, check it out.

203
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:29,068
Damn it!

204
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,941
- Hey, you didn't pay your bill!
- The red "X"! Red "X"!

205
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,609
Hey, it's a good thing
that space outlet had lab coats

206
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,511
and your favorite kind of shirt
in stock, huh, Morty?

207
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,147
Yeah, Rick, I-I heard
you the first time.

208
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,815
You don't have to keep saying it
over and over.

209
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:44,784
Man, this place is way
off the grid.

210
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:46,152
This guy does not
want to be found.

211
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:47,320
Well, if he's a Rick,

212
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:49,288
doesn't he just have to stand by
a Morty to hide?

213
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,490
I mean, isn't that what Mortys
are -- human cloaking devices?

214
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:54,927
Morty, you're making a bigger
deal out of this than it is.

215
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:57,930
Oh, my God, Rick, look!

216
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,366
There's a bunch of people
strapped all over that building!

217
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:03,869
Not people, Morty -- Mortys.

218
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:11,379
Oh, God!

219
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:14,347
W-w-why would somebody do this?
It's horrible!

220
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:16,048
Well, one Morty's enough to
hide from the bureaucrats,

221
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,050
but you get -- you
get a whole matrix of Mortys and

222
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,218
put them in agonizing pain,

223
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,488
that creates a pattern that can hide
even from other Ricks [beep].

224
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,858
I fiddled with a concept
like this once.

225
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,960
On paper, Morty. On paper.

226
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,162
I wouldn't do this.
It's barbaric overkill.

227
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,397
I mean, you could accomplish
the same result with, like,

228
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,233
five Mortys and a jumper cable.

229
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,778
Which I also wouldn't do!

230
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,206
I'm just saying,
it's bad craftsmanship.

231
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:41,874
- Coffee time!
- Yeah!

232
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:42,541
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

233
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:44,778
That's what I like to hear!

234
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:48,147
- Hi, Jerry.
- Leave me alone.

235
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,081
I'm working.

236
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,049
Oh, you are?

237
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:52,051
W-w-w-what do you do?

238
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:54,220
I-I'm -- I'm in between
advertising jobs.

239
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:56,188
Advertising? Wow!

240
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,423
So, people need help figuring

241
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:59,525
out what to buy, and then
y-y-you help 'em?

242
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:02,424
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

243
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,829
Well, I mean, you do it,

244
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,265
and you seem like a guy who
really has it all together.

245
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:13,072
Dude, are you -- w--
you're being a dick, right?

246
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,875
Oh, gosh, I-I hope not. I wouldn't
want to offend you in any way.

247
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:18,411
You're really a Rick?

248
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:21,881
Y-- of course I am -- just as
much as my Morty's a Morty.

249
00:11:21,883 --> 00:11:25,580
Hey, he looks a lot like Eric
Stoltz from the movie "mask."

250
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:27,386
You know, the one
with Cher in it?

251
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:28,421
That's right, Jerry!

252
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:30,089
He -- he's from a reality where

253
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:32,191
everyone is Eric Stoltz "mask"
people.

254
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,559
He's Eric Stoltz mask Morty.

255
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:35,227
They assigned him to me because

256
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:36,896
I never had any kids of my own.

257
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,397
But if I did, boy, I'd love them

258
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,932
if they were as smart and as

259
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,367
successful as <i>you</i> are, Jerry.

260
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:42,902
Hey, get a load of this.

261
00:11:42,904 --> 00:11:44,937
Jerry's hanging out with
doofus Rick.

262
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:46,372
This is perfect.

263
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:47,940
I'm not doofus Rick!

264
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:49,241
I'm Rick j19-zeta-7!

265
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:51,977
Oh, is that the timeline
where everybody eats poop?

266
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:54,146
Jerry, you know this guy eats
poop, right?

267
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:55,414
Hey, I don't eat poop!

268
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,850
Y-you guys are always
so mean to me.

269
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:02,421
I guess it's only fair to tell
you now, Jerry.

270
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:03,989
I'm the worst Rick of them all.

271
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,392
According to who --
other versions of you?

272
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:07,993
If I've learned one thing,

273
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:09,928
it's that before you
get anywhere in life,

274
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,597
you got to stop listening
to yourself.

275
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,432
Wow.
You really are wise, Jerry.

276
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,634
I-I-I guess that's why you work
in advertising.

277
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:19,472
The fact that you feel that way makes
you the <i>best</i> Rick of them all.

278
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:21,640
You don't care about me at all!

279
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:24,143
I'm no different than that
jacket you've got on!

280
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:26,345
Y-y-y-- o-or your stupid portal
gun!

281
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:27,246
I'm just a tool!

282
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,314
I-I-I'm just an object!

283
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:31,016
Hey, it's your choice
to take it personally, Morty.

284
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,618
Now, for the love of God,
be quiet.

285
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,286
The point of this is to get the
drop on the guy.

286
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,088
You know what, Rick?
I'll tell you something!

287
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,289
I'm more than a human shield!

288
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,457
Yeah, that's right.

289
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,024
You <i>are</i>.

290
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,460
You're a perfect, impenetrable
suit of human armor, Morty,

291
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:42,662
because you're as dumb as I am

292
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:44,430
smart, which is why when I say

293
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,432
"shut up," it's really
good advice.

294
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,903
Great. Nice work, Morty.

295
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:06,152
Ooh. Look at you, C-137.

296
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:08,020
You -- aren't you a tough
customer.

297
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:09,288
The slow clap? Really?

298
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,389
Kind of played out, dude.

299
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:12,191
Not in this dimension, it isn't.

300
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:13,959
In fact I invented it.

301
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,061
Nobody else has ever even done
it here before.

302
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,196
Well, la-di-da.

303
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:18,531
Hey, that's mine!

304
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:25,538
I don't like the look
of that Rick, Morty.

305
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,173
- We got to escape.
- I'm not gonna help you, Rick.

306
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:29,375
- Y-you're a monster.
- Don't be Rick-diculous, Morty.

307
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:31,544
Will you -- will you
stop saying that?

308
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:32,412
It's stupid.

309
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:33,813
Take his Morty away.

310
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:34,747
Come with me.

311
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:36,182
Yeah, gladly.

312
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:38,518
Geez, man. Ricks, huh?

313
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,553
Hey, man, you seem to know how
this place works.

314
00:13:40,555 --> 00:13:41,755
Is there any way we could shut

315
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:44,390
down that grid and rescue all
those Mortys outside?

316
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:45,591
It would be pointless.

317
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:48,761
Mortys have no chance of
defeating a Rick.

318
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:49,896
In here.

319
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,207
- Ah. Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah, yeah.

320
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:03,609
Looks like payday at
Neverland ranch in here.

321
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:04,210
Zing!

322
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,914
<i>- That</i> guy got it.
- Unh-unh-unh, Rick. Quiet.

323
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,882
You're missing my symphony.

324
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:14,787
Hey, I'll take it
over Mumford & Sons.

325
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:15,555
Zip!

326
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:17,357
This guy is on it!

327
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,425
He's not laughing at your
dumb jokes, Rick.

328
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:22,795
That's just a random noise it
makes every 10 seconds.

329
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,633
You see, Rick, you're not as
clever as you think you are.

330
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:28,935
I <i>wanted</i> you to find me.

331
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:31,437
We're not so different, you and I.

332
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:32,572
Yeah, duh!

333
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:34,273
See this right here, Rick?

334
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:35,475
I crunched the numbers.

335
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:37,643
I created a spectrum
of all the Ricks.

336
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:40,446
I listed them out from most evil
to least evil.

337
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:41,481
Here's where I am.

338
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:44,250
And look it -- right here's where
you are, Rick.

339
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:45,885
This guy right here --
super-weird.

340
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:46,719
I get it.

341
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:47,887
So you want me to team up with

342
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,789
you to take down the council of
Ricks, right?

343
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,457
Is that where you're
going with this?

344
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:52,792
'Cause that's where
<i>I'd</i> be going.

345
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:53,426
Please.

346
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:55,595
I think I'm doing pretty good on
my own.

347
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:56,963
I'm simply gonna download the

348
00:14:56,965 --> 00:15:00,833
contents of your brain and then
kill you.

349
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:02,769
Okay, if we add a little more

350
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:06,305
titanium nitrate and just a tad
of chlorified tartrate...

351
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,776
...Ovenless brownies!

352
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,577
Mmm. Mmm!

353
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:12,812
It's incredible what a gifted

354
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:14,981
mind can accomplish when
priorities are in order.

355
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:15,848
Well, come on.

356
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,650
I can't take <i>all</i> the credit,
Jerry.

357
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:20,486
- It was <i>your</i> idea.
- Come here, Jerry!

358
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,259
Hey, uh, come here.

359
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:28,694
I-I want to show you something.

360
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:31,396
Okay, look, everybody makes
fun of me for getting these,

361
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,799
but you're a genius scientist.

362
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:33,999
What do <i>you</i> think? See?

363
00:15:34,002 --> 00:15:37,703
There's little R2-D2s where the
George Washingtons should be.

364
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:40,640
You know, Jerry, I'm not
gonna tell you that these will

365
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:43,309
increase in value or even hold
their <i>current</i> value.

366
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:45,812
The truth is, you bought them
because you like them.

367
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:46,979
They have value to <i>you</i>.

368
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:48,848
That's what matters.

369
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,921
- How long are you staying?
- Until we find your Rick.

370
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:58,923
I found mine.

371
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,597
- Help!
- There is no escape, my son.

372
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:06,431
We will find our peace in the
next world.

373
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,501
So, what -- you're
just gonna give up?

374
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:11,971
We're giving in -- to the
power of the one true Morty.

375
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:13,639
One day, he will return.

376
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:17,110
Praise the one true Morty.

377
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,412
Ugh.

378
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,347
All right, Mortys, listen up.

379
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:25,051
My name is Morty Smith, from
earth dimension C-137.

380
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:27,587
I know you're scared, because
<i>I'm</i> scared.

381
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,889
But that's no reason to accept
our fate!

382
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:30,756
We're Mortys!

383
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:33,526
We're not defined by our
relationships to Rick!

384
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,828
Our destiny is our own!

385
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,531
This sounds like something
the one true Morty might say.

386
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,032
I'm sick of being a human
shield.

387
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:42,068
I want to be a gardener!

388
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,571
I want to write really crazy,
intense action novels!

389
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:47,707
I'm more than just a hammer!

390
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,675
He is the one true Morty!

391
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:50,576
Hooray!

392
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:52,044
The one true Morty!

393
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:53,913
Hey, keep it down!

394
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:06,059
You've lived quite a life, Rick.

395
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:09,262
It's a real shame you're not gonna
be around to see it through.

396
00:17:17,264 --> 00:17:21,607
- You're crying? Over a Morty?
- No, I'm just allergic to dipshits.

397
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,608
Ugh. Pathetic.

398
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,376
We both know that if there's
any truth in the universe,

399
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,148
it's that Ricks don't
care about Mortys.

400
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,719
Do your worst, you little
bastards!

401
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:34,954
Kill me! Do it!

402
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:36,656
Do I-I-I-I-it!

403
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:38,591
Morty! Thank God!

404
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:39,959
Get me out of this.

405
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:40,560
Come on!

406
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:42,428
You're lucky I'm not a Rick.

407
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,831
Point taken, but this
is no time for arcs.

408
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:48,935
Oh!

409
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,007
Yeah, hello.

410
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,410
Hey, what do me and
O.J. not have in common?

411
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:58,477
Huh? W-who is this?

412
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,813
I found the real killer, bitch!

413
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,381
Get over here!

414
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,720
Yo, ding-dong, we're done here.
Time to go.

415
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:11,591
Well, Jerry, I guess
this means goodbye.

416
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:13,492
W-w-well, does it have to?

417
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:15,595
I mean, you -- you look just
like Rick.

418
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:17,797
We could maybe, you know, get
rid of him.

419
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,832
I'm not saying kill him,
necessarily.

420
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,100
I -- I'm also not saying

421
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:23,035
necessarily <i>not</i> kill him, but --

422
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:25,771
Jerry, w-we both know it
wouldn't work.

423
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:28,841
It's time to go back to our
lives.

424
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:30,977
I love you, Jerry.
I love you.

425
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:49,596
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

426
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:56,336
W-what -- w-what's gonna
happen to all these Mortys?

427
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:58,904
They'll go back to their
families, attend school

428
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:02,541
regularly, play video games,
date girls.

429
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:05,711
Poor little rickless bastards.

430
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:08,047
Earth Rick C-137, the council

431
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,649
apologizes for its false

432
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,217
accusation, and in the way of

433
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:13,052
reparations for our

434
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:14,920
terrible mistake, we would like

435
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,656
to compensate you with this

436
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:18,491
voucher for a free replacement

437
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:19,859
Morty in the event that

438
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:21,560
your current Morty should --

439
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,896
Uh, guys, not a good time.

440
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:25,598
Come on, Morty. Let's hit it.

441
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,103
Is it time for arcs yet, Rick?

442
00:19:30,105 --> 00:19:33,205
I did a pretty good job back there
for a human cloaking device.

443
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:33,939
Saved your ass.

444
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:35,007
All right, Morty.

445
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,742
Don't break an arm jerking
yourself off.

446
00:19:36,744 --> 00:19:38,577
Man, I can't believe you, Rick.

447
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,745
That right there, that w-- that

448
00:19:39,747 --> 00:19:42,581
was a great opportunity to show
a little humanity, you know?

449
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,150
- To connect with me a little.
- Hey, Morty, you want connection,

450
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:47,719
go be part of some stupid club,
like all those dumb Ricks.

451
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:50,222
You know, maybe I don't connect
because I'm the rickest Rick there is.

452
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:51,590
And, you know, it would

453
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:53,092
g-- Go without saying

454
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:55,761
that the rickest Rick would have
the Mortyest Morty.

455
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:59,098
- It would go without saying, huh?
- Yeah, it would.

456
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,901
- Did you hear me say it?
- Nah.

457
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:02,902
The Mortyest Morty.

458
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:05,871
Just don't get too big
for your loafers, Buster brown.

459
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,040
A cocky Morty can lead to some
big problems.

460
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,076
It can be a real bad thing for
everybody.

461
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,744
Oh, yeah? How's that?

462
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:14,747
U-uh, I'll explain when
you're older.

463
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:18,951
- What a mess.
- Pride cometh before the fall.

464
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:20,886
I guess he got what he deserved.

465
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:21,787
What is <i>that</i>?

466
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:24,623
Hand me the laser difibulator.

467
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,292
Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help?

468
00:20:26,294 --> 00:20:27,660
No! Go clean the toilets.

469
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:29,595
Maybe you'll make friends with
some turds.

470
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:31,897
You make us ashamed to be
ourselves!

471
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:37,580
My God.
I've seen this technology before.

472
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:39,805
This Rick was being
controlled remotely --

473
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,173
puppeteered by somebody else.

474
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:42,274
This is the receiver.

475
00:20:42,276 --> 00:20:45,244
Yeah, but where's the
transmitter?

476
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:37,263
- Wubba dubba dub dub!
- Oh. Hey, Jerry.

477
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:39,232
What are you doing
in my room, buddy?

478
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:42,868
Nothing. I was just, um,
checking the smoke detectors.

479
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,036
All right.

480
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:45,571
Okay, get out.

481
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:10,629
What's that dipshit doing out there?
Are you friends with him?

482
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,231
You know he eats his own shit,
right?

483
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:14,166
Oh, my God, this is rich!

484
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:17,069
I've got like 10 Ricks
to call right now.

485
00:22:17,594 --> 00:22:23,594
