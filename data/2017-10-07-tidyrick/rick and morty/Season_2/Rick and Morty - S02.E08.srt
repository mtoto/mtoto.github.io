Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,258
Hi, honey,
so, here's the thing...

256
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,360
these guys...
they want to completely

257
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:24,130
remove my penis and use it
as an alien's heart.

And we just need you
to sign off on it.

- Uh-oh.

Now, there's a wide range
of options to choose from.

They're all in this catalogue.

Oh, I don't think you do.

268
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,953

but on earth, love comes first.

that shrimply pibbles represents
love between all life.

of sentient life-forms.

279

the full gravity
of the situation.

283
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,223
Uh, well, Beth,
I don't think your decision

284
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,758
should be based on politics.

285
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,993
Who could argue
with a wife's decision

286
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,395
to keep her lover intact?

287
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:32,398
Well, I don't think that's
fair at all, Jerry. At all.

288
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,934
In fact, the whole paradigm
has sexist overtones.

289
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:37,436
Beth, can we talk
about this privately.

290
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:40,005
You know, I think
the bottom line is, Jerry,

291
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:43,409
if you want to keep your penis,
you should say, out loud,

292
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,077
"I prefer to keep my penis."

293
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,747
But, Beth, what kind of man
would say something like that

294
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:49,548
if the universe needed
his penis?!

295
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,017
Well, Jerry,
what kind of wife would I be

296
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,854
if I did anything
to stand in your way?

297

It looks like regular food,
but really tiny.

You can put it in your mouth
and eat it.

Nothing gets stuck in your lips.
