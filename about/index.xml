      <description>My name is Tamas and I am a self-employed Data Scientist available for consulting on data analytics projects. I was born in Budapest, studied in Leuven and St. Andrews, and have worked in Montreal and Amsterdam.
My main area of expertise is digital analytics, however I have worked on projects in a variety of industries such as online media, e-commerce, travel and banking. I love solving business problems with data, discovering new insights and building scalable solutions.</description>
